 to speak any more . <end>   1030.9821877440718

 and anxious attention , while she added , 
 
 " When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that 
 either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from 
 knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . " 
 
 Wickham 's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated 
 look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his 
 embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of 
 accents , 
 
 " You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr . Darcy , will readily 
 comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume 
 even the _appearance_ of what is right . <end>   983.252560777952

 taken himself out of the way . <end>   880.316874744927

 " They have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he ; " they are 
 all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of 
 quickness than her sisters . "

 finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to 
 his fear of discovery by Lydia 's relations , for it had just transpired 
 that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable 
 amount . <end>   819.5397659452569
<start> <start> Jane listened with astonishment and concern ; - - she 
 knew not how to believe that Mr . Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr . 
 Bingley 's regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the 
 veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham . - - The 
 possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to 
 interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be 
 done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and 
 throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be 
 otherwise explained . <end>   911.9775402398772

 Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or 
 miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she 
 thought she could witness without trepidation . <end>   1015.9382955089792

 on each side with the utmost politeness . <end>   1421.8690945415356
<start> <start> In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his 
 studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all

 Mr . Philips 's house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia 's 
 pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs . <end>   730.7714425641503

 beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected 
 them round the table . <end>   641.3606954900542
<start> <start> Gardiner gave her the 
 particulars also of Miss Bingley 's visit in Gracechurch - street , and 
 repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and 
 herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the 
 acquaintance . <end>   970.1273578775188

 directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr . Darcy 's 
 sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , 
 she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road . <end>   1120.4899905608265

 them , as nonsense ? <end>   601.2612297072084
<start> <start> Let me do it without farther loss of time . <end>   1615.6957462036785
<start> <start> She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in 
 silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for 
 in Darcy 's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , 
 which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against 
 another . <end>   1140.9969849146703

 officers of the - - - - shire were in general a very creditable , 
 gentleman - like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but 
 Mr . Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and 
 walk , as _they_ were superior to the broad - faced stuffy uncle Philips , 
 breathing port wine , who followed them into the room . <end>   661.525485426271

 mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent 
 to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was 
 unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . " 
 
 Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his 
 friend . <end>   736.8122442018539

 of the morning . <end>   1094.6473663069382

 that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection 
 could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of 
 endeavouring even to like Bingley 's two sisters . <end>   1287.3630592223255
<start> <start> Mr . 
 Bingley 's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but 
 since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt 
 the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of 
 both gentlemen as I did before . " 
 
 She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on 
 which there could be no difference of sentiment . <end>   993.1323238805047
<start> <start> Bennet , in 
 the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good 
 humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour 's visit , had 
 revived . <end>   839.8575796391436

 as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a 
 moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was 
 opened by a servant , and Mr . Darcy appeared . <end>   714.5963391027932
<start> <start> As her successor in that house , she 
 regarded her with jealous abhorrence . <end>   658.6922260839883
<start> <start> I shall offer to pay him to - morrow ; he will rant and storm about 
 his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . " 
 
 He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading 
 Mr . Collins 's letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her 
 at last to go - - saying , as she quitted the room , " If any young men come 
 for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . " 
 
 Elizabeth 's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after 
 half an hour 's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join 
 the others with tolerable composure . <end>   1022.6514259270335

 _such_ a girl to be my nephew 's sister ? <end>   1294.2179180773035
<start> <start> Bingley was sure of 
 being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence . <end>   1807.7932484332794
<start> <start> But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no 
 extraordinary stretch of belief . <end>   1028.8336561100357
<start> <start> Elizabeth 
 was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and 
 pleased . <end>   648.7891991081383
<start> <start> He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . " 
 
 " My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them - - by which 
 means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents . " 
 
 " Your humility , Mr . Bingley , " said Elizabeth , " must disarm reproof . " 
 
 " Nothing is more deceitful , " said Darcy , " than the appearance of 
 humility . <end>   527.0138668654722

 my discernment ! - - I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! <end>   703.6838977851551
<start> <start> She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till 
 they were joined by Mr . Collins , who entered with an air more stately 
 than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , 
 
 " Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and 
 let Mr . Collins and me have a little conversation together . " 
 
 Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but 
 Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , 
 detained first by the civility of Mr . Collins , whose inquiries after 
 herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little 
 curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending 
 not to hear . <end>   841.4408972811733

 brother for talking such nonsense . <end>   925.0910626217147

 a day or two since we first came ! - - and yet how many things have

 to understand . <end>   853.6486217699655

 she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! <end>   1689.3129503215393

 every remarkable spot and point of view . <end>   1521.5507029864639

 ill - tempered man . " Wickham only shook his head . <end>   969.8117704171802

 consequence as _this_ should ensue , you may easily believe was far 
 enough from my thoughts . "

 being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . " 
 
 On his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have 
 any intention of speaking , Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such 
 a subject to him , which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it , she 
 turned to him and said , 
 
 " Did not you think , Mr . Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well 
 just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at 
 Meryton ? " 
 
 " With great energy ; - - but it is a subject which always makes a lady 
 energetic . " 
 
 " You are severe on us . "

 Mr . Bennet 's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two 
 thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in 
 default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother 's 
 fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply 
 the deficiency of his . <end>   715.8595486714495
<start> <start> If _I_ can 
 perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to 
 discover it too . " 
 
 " Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane 's disposition as you do . " 
 
 " But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal 
 it , he must find it out . " 
 
 " Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . <end>   713.4105306813965
<start> <start> Bennet found , with amazement and horror , 
 that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his 
 daughter . <end>   791.1195927975608

 rather taller . " 
 
 " How I long to see her again ! <end>   715.971786997297

 fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper

 relieved . <end>   2294.1108044444404
<start> <start> Forster called her , and they were going to the 
 camp ; - - and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less 
 to be learnt - - for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much 
 too full of lines under the words to be made public . <end>   983.1332535940762
<start> <start> I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare 
 say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world . <end>   785.437544413113
<start> <start> " Very well . - - That reply will do for the present . - - Perhaps by and bye I 
 may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public 
 ones . - - But _now_ we may be silent . "

 " Sometimes . <end>   1021.4468088353018
<start> <start> Her tour to the Lakes 
 was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation 
 for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her 
 mother and Kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included Jane in 
 the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . <end>   1002.9506595890532

 now . " 
 
 Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr . Bingley had been a most delightful 
 friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked 
 herself . <end>   808.7429298851911
<start> <start> " And they are really to be married ! " cried Elizabeth , as soon as they 
 were by themselves . <end>   711.5197400313307

 to a window to enjoy its prospect . <end>   987.3630834251578
<start> <start> It will be in my power to 
 assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se 'night . " 
 
 Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him 
 that Mr . Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as 
 an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it 
 was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either 
 side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr . Darcy , the superior in 
 consequence , to begin the acquaintance . - - Mr . Collins listened to her 
 with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she 
 ceased speaking , replied thus , 
 
 " My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your 
 excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your 
 understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference 
 between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those 
 which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that I consider 
 the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank 
 in the kingdom - - provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the 
 same time maintained . <end>   964.2526828056915
<start> <start> Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , 
 and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without 
 calling her attention . <end>   770.7931206675067
<start> <start> My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I 
 confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due . " 
 
 " My object _then_ , " replied Darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility 
 in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped 
 to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you 
 see that your reproofs had been attended to . <end>   849.1365026077857

<start> <start> In no countenance was attentive 
 curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley 's , in spite of the 
 smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its 
 objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions

<start> <start> After playing some Italian songs , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a 
 lively Scotch air ; and soon afterwards Mr . Darcy , drawing near 
 Elizabeth , said to her - - 
 
 " Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an 
 opportunity of dancing a reel ? " 
 
 She smiled , but made no answer . <end>   794.4917541550353

 acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , frankly and openly . " 
 
 Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " Yes , you know enough of 
 my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_ . <end>   707.4142657868179
<start> <start> Their manner of living , even when the

 was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight 's time . <end>   939.2966343814765

<start> <start> I knew it myself , as 
 it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant 
 of it . - - That they might have met without ill consequence , is 
 perhaps probable ; - - but his regard did not appear to me enough 
 extinguished for him to see her without some danger . - - Perhaps this 
 concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . - - It is done , however , 
 and it was done for the best . - - On this subject I have nothing more 
 to say , no other apology to offer . <end>   831.2682344589906

 protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery 
 tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . <end>   1940.6720567412015
<start> <start> Though I 
 _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though I would not injure him 
 so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on 
 setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to 
 you . " 
 
 " If you believed it impossible to be true , " said Elizabeth , colouring 
 with astonishment and disdain , " I wonder you took the trouble of coming 
 so far . <end>   825.6559944853414
<start> <start> The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I

 To Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any 
 degree interesting . <end>   1386.476388694101

 do we ? " 
 
 Darcy had walked away to another part of the room . <end>   815.5848302664702

 intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled . <end>   434.3634758902186
<start> <start> When Mr . Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he 
 sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon 
 as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn . <end>   843.9559811381632
<start> <start> Had not my own feelings decided 
 against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been 
 favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept 
 the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the 
 happiness of a most beloved sister ? " 
 
 As she pronounced these words , Mr . Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion 
 was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she 
 continued . <end>   1049.3290951123818

 you keep winking at me for ? <end>   775.0371151744725

 himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite congratulation ; Mr . Hurst 
 also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but diffuseness 
 and warmth remained for Bingley 's salutation . <end>   1026.7888978362273

 again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but

 alarming nature , reached me two days ago . <end>   2110.9437263338705

 his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having 
 no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the 
 moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the 
 observances which he supposed a regular part of the business . <end>   934.2032303051974
<start> <start> In future , I hope we shall be always of one 
 mind . " 
 
 She held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though 
 he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house . <end>   943.5582568782875
<start> <start> She then took a large house in Edward - street , 
 and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . <end>   1016.1875793571946

 surprised , very much surprised , - - so lately as Mr . Collins was wishing to 
 marry you . <end>   651.1831164046092

 spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt 
 had reserved for them . <end>   970.5862430525799

 may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . <end>   936.5545426441139
<start> <start> as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended 
 there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if 
 Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we 
 behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest 
 cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have 
 treated you too . <end>   840.1081662833101
<start> <start> We neither of us perform to strangers . " 
 
 Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know 
 what they were talking of . <end>   1230.203323062452
<start> <start> The subject elevated him 
 to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect 
 he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a 
 person of rank - - such affability and condescension , as he had himself 
 experienced from Lady Catherine . <end>   1332.3999791959095
<start> <start> It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline 's 
 interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those 
 wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man 
 so totally independent of every one . <end>   1077.6296186058223

 not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it . <end>   550.0045090655195

 expected . <end>   643.6607855586586

 it . <end>   899.7946939153206

 disconcerted . <end>   297.20586525077204

 neighbours in Meryton . <end>   859.8672980964687
<start> <start> CHAPTER XVII . 
 
 
 " My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question 
 which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and 
 from all the others when they sat down to table . <end>   833.1676020753837
<start> <start> Mr . Collins , however , was not 
 discouraged from speaking again , and Mr . Darcy 's contempt seemed 
 abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the 
 end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way . <end>   936.5465552198013
<start> <start> " You may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to 
 know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively 
 speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such 
 a time . <end>   1134.6872858477054
<start> <start> He took the hint , and soon began with , " This seems a very comfortable 
 house . <end>   1026.763036933493
<start> <start> He knows of my 
 being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and 
 yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to 
 persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . <end>   947.5197755978731
<start> <start> Such a disappointment ! <end>   2089.6440394721494
<start> <start> " She is so fond of Mrs . <end>   629.4803056411184
<start> <start> " Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , 
 and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful 
 little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss 
 Grantley 's . " 
 
 " Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? - - At 
 present I have not room to do them justice . " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   996.3459958030915
<start> <start> To all the 
 objections I have already urged , I have still another to add . <end>   1235.0784368361308
<start> <start> A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without 
 scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William 
 or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she 
 could at all forgive their daughter . <end>   1416.3055510930021
<start> <start> Haggerston has our directions , and 
 all will be completed in a week . <end>   569.4907918023289
<start> <start> Elizabeth 
 had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did 
 not appear in the least affected by it . <end>   924.4692202323909
<start> <start> I will put on my things in a moment . <end>   936.438308985457
<start> <start> why is not every body as happy ? " 
 
 Elizabeth 's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a 
 delight , which words could but poorly express . <end>   1203.299238848849
<start> <start> As they passed through the hall , 
 Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining - parlour and 
 drawing - room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent 
 looking rooms , walked on . <end>   1110.933533343844
<start> <start> " Haye - Park might do , " said she , " if the Gouldings would quit it , or the 
 great house at Stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but Ashworth is 
 too far off ! <end>   702.8476350479251
<start> <start> But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? <end>   944.8857942369106

 women better worth their notice . <end>   2450.154775301865

 heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his 
 own future property . <end>   923.2818104480205
<start> <start> I was sure you loved your girls too well to 
 neglect such an acquaintance . <end>   1306.4796229765757
<start> <start> He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his 
 intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to 
 be within . <end>   681.7115404636569
<start> <start> There was also a postscript to this 
 effect . <end>   1169.6140793836587
<start> <start> Pray read on . " 
 
 " After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last 
 night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she 
 felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some 
 family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her 
 consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match . <end>   1090.929832313949
<start> <start> Oh ! <end>   890.4766571964334
<start> <start> You will be a very happy woman . " 
 
 Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his 
 goodness . <end>   601.5714406112374
<start> <start> My dear Hill , have you 
 heard the good news ? <end>   1138.4008712236905
<start> <start> I know not what to think . <end>   413.58873476440306
<start> <start> Her resistance had not 
 injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some 
 complacency , when thus accosted by Miss Bingley , 
 
 " I can guess the subject of your reverie . " 
 
 " I should imagine not . " 
 
 " You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings 
 in this manner - - in such society ; and indeed I am quite of your opinion . <end>   571.9959938693022
<start> <start> And when you have given _your_ ball , " she 
 added , " I shall insist on their giving one also . <end>   1232.1484196188003
<start> <start> Every thing , however , went on smoothly , 
 and was finally settled according to Charlotte 's first sketch . <end>   854.0225852515601
<start> <start> On the contrary every particular relative 
 to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and 
 if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who 
 will believe me ? <end>   959.0893708298034
<start> <start> She is 
 a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but 
 I will _make_ her know it . " 
 
 " Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , " cried Mr . Collins ; " but if she 
 is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would 
 altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who 
 naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . <end>   790.9970550442039

 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to

<start> <start> I am so happy . <end>   539.1097900070326
<start> <start> Gardiner were half a quarter of a 
 mile behind . <end>   1380.6303541284005
<start> <start> I 
 did not expect such a compliment . " 
 
 " Did not you ? <end>   507.6797255479498
<start> <start> It was a subject , in short , on 
 which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . <end>   498.5308475043381
<start> <start> " I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , " said he , " that a ball of 
 this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can 
 have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself 
 that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins 
 in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting 
 yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , - - a 
 preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right 
 cause , and not to any disrespect for her . " 
 
 Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . <end>   794.4490856926274
<start> <start> I shall like it of all 
 things . <end>   543.8248181235622
<start> <start> But it was a hope 
 shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her 
 vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for 
 her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a 
 sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham . <end>   1328.5519229487243
<start> <start> " It is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be 
 able to see your friends before they leave the country . <end>   801.4102315671172
<start> <start> She had 
 gained her point , and had time to consider of it . <end>   553.3124744745644
<start> <start> Where shall you change 
 horses ? - - Oh ! <end>   1947.3946837010922
<start> <start> I speak nothing but the truth . <end>   769.1097345702269
<start> <start> It is only that he has better means of having it than 
 many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . <end>   1185.962287253942
<start> <start> " I never heard any thing so 
 abominable . <end>   811.968535648953
<start> <start> " Read it aloud , " said their father , " for I hardly know myself what it is 
 about . "

<start> <start> The Miss 
 Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as 
 your 's . - - Do you draw ? " 
 
 " No , not at all . " 
 
 " What , none of you ? " 
 
 " Not one . " 
 
 " That is very strange . <end>   526.1428935494104
<start> <start> Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with 
 much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the 
 end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by 
 Scotch and Irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with 
 some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing 
 at one end of the room . <end>   917.6247113529248
<start> <start> With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " How long did you 
 say that he was at Rosings ? " 
 
 " Nearly three weeks . " 
 
 " And you saw him frequently ? " 
 
 " Yes , almost every day . " 
 
 " His manners are very different from his cousin 's . " 
 
 " Yes , very different . <end>   692.221949990409
<start> <start> If I could but see _you_ as happy ! <end>   1422.1019888446417
<start> <start> On the contrary she was as much disposed to 
 complain of it as her husband . - - It was very strange that he should come 
 to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient 
 and exceedingly troublesome . - - She hated having visitors in the house 
 while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the 
 most disagreeable . <end>   1183.6269865890845
<start> <start> After a short silence , the lady first spoke . <end>   1307.0271367743312
<start> <start> In 
 talking over their route the evening before , Mrs . <end>   1206.025749839247
<start> <start> Her brother 's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his 
 judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as 
 to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than 
 lovely and amiable . <end>   1323.0428409681683
<start> <start> 'Ah ! <end>   267.5295799222882
<start> <start> That will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at 
 table for him . " 
 
 Consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her 
 husband 's incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her 
 neighbours might all see Mr . Bingley in consequence of it , before _they_ 
 did . <end>   805.6624057967189

 my part , except the shops and public places . <end>   1189.168823380583
<start> <start> He had found the law a most unprofitable study , 
 and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would 
 present him to the living in question - - of which he trusted there 
 could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other 
 person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered 
 father 's intentions . <end>   876.6621505734039
<start> <start> However , I did not hear above one word in ten , 
 for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . <end>   897.4110077493337
<start> <start> She was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over 
 unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her 
 disposition . <end>   1016.7282601896378

<start> <start> Elizabeth , equally 
 next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . <end>   909.8452841614776
<start> <start> She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she 
 made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the 
 neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or 
 two , to visit his relations . <end>   1079.70720558745
<start> <start> Mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but 
 she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no 
 longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters 'beauty and her own , 
 it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without 
 much reluctance . <end>   696.488222996626
<start> <start> Let me thank you again and again , 
 in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced 
 you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the 
 sake of discovering them . " 
 
 " If you _will_ thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone . <end>   735.1420970485083

<start> <start> CHAPTER XIX . 
 
 
 The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn . <end>   1344.0736489553944
<start> <start> All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . <end>   1977.497695828576
<start> <start> There was one part 
 especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the 
 power of reading again . <end>   991.6387037793342
<start> <start> Tell her that you insist upon her 
 marrying him . " 
 
 " Let her be called down . <end>   840.4042240936112
<start> <start> Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours 
 of repose should not be broken in on . <end>   753.619874824892
<start> <start> " But , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects 
 delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you 
 while you have been here . " 
 
 Elizabeth made no objection ; - - the door was then allowed to be shut , and 
 the carriage drove off . <end>   924.8529788346224
<start> <start> Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . " 
 
 The colour now rushed into Elizabeth 's cheeks in the instantaneous 
 conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; 
 and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained 
 himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to 
 herself ; when her father continued , 
 
 " You look conscious . <end>   816.8963641757871
<start> <start> Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail 
 bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of 
 five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about . <end>   1524.669756411508
<start> <start> She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , 
 and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her pool of 
 quadrille in the evening . <end>   937.4016873158283
<start> <start> She answered with equal 
 indifference and brevity , and the other said no more . <end>   648.8769055029653
<start> <start> My father was not 
 only fond of this young man 's society , whose manners were always 
 engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the 
 church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . <end>   1254.2210817918753
<start> <start> As yet , she 
 cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its 
 reasonableness . <end>   702.0509091572394
<start> <start> " _You_ want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . " 
 
 This was invitation enough . <end>   746.6275650686183
<start> <start> Your 's , very 
 sincerely , 
 
 " M . GARDINER . " 
 
 The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , 
 in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the 
 greatest share . <end>   878.2622450798502
<start> <start> Recovering himself , however , shortly , 
 he turned to his partner , and said , 
 
 " Sir William 's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . " 
 
 " I do not think we were speaking at all . <end>   700.3760773450705
<start> <start> All were struck with the stranger 's air , 
 all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if 
 possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of 
 wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained 
 the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same 
 spot . <end>   1340.2148954318163
<start> <start> At any rate , she cannot grow 
 many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest 
 of her life . " 
 
 With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion 
 continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . <end>   733.5977116852197
<start> <start> CHAPTER XVI . 
 
 
 It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out 
 together from Gracechurch - street , for the town of - - - - in Hertfordshire ; 
 and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr . Bennet 's carriage was 
 to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman 's 
 punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room up 
 stairs . <end>   832.8718965271573
<start> <start> Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as 
 Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , 
 came up with him , and eagerly cried out , 
 
 " Oh , Papa , what news ? <end>   602.2302407649909
<start> <start> Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of 
 me . <end>   965.9667968624146
<start> <start> But the 
 clothes , the wedding clothes ! <end>   996.4015444467235
<start> <start> There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming 
 to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on 
 my diligence and care . <end>   1038.4677059316405
<start> <start> Bennet was really in a most pitiable state . <end>   712.4486002555988
<start> <start> Lady Catherine had been rendered so 
 exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew 's letter , that 
 Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till 
 the storm was blown over . <end>   1019.3163690408741
<start> <start> At length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels 
 placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . <end>   754.5970685924524
<start> <start> There - - I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; 
 and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly 
 reasonable . <end>   823.244465351226
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   243.39116572125704
<start> <start> Kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped 
 her turn was coming soon . <end>   786.7697056963707
<start> <start> After this period , every 
 appearance of acquaintance was dropt . <end>   1300.034628003588
<start> <start> Their lodgings were not long a secret , 
 and at length they began to know the officers themselves . <end>   1468.3508104401258
<start> <start> It has been my own doing , 
 and I ought to feel it . " 
 
 " You must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied Elizabeth . <end>   704.8110540916209
<start> <start> I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , 
 unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope _my_ dinners 
 are good enough for her . <end>   982.7117614368858
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   243.39116572125704
<start> <start> My situation in life , my connections 
 with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are 
 circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther 
 consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no 
 means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . <end>   1192.6196212536324
<start> <start> <NUM> . E . <NUM> . <end>   620.4171973851599
<start> <start> They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , 
 were to entertain each other . <end>   689.0536193084599
<start> <start> I was so vexed to see him stand 
 up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody 
 can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going 
 down the dance . <end>   898.1490486195717
<start> <start> " Yes - - if Darcy does not put it off again . <end>   1082.8965964311096
<start> <start> A man of honour could not have doubted the 
 intention , but Mr . Darcy chose to doubt it - - or to treat it as a merely 
 conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim 
 to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing . <end>   1002.9967065873516
<start> <start> Bennet , " that you should be so 
 ready to think your own children silly . <end>   834.7250062679506
<start> <start> Bennet could hardly 
 contain herself . <end>   1052.3763941045154
<start> <start> Why should they try to influence him ? <end>   2188.536824732101
<start> <start> But though 
 every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him 
 by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend 
 that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion . <end>   759.6507662076511
<start> <start> " Can it be 
 possible that he will marry her ? " 
 
 " Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her 
 sister . <end>   479.1213600536835
<start> <start> Do 
 you often dance at St . James 's ? " 
 
 " Never , sir . " 
 
 " Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " 
 
 " It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . " 
 
 " You have a house in town , I conclude ? " 
 
 Mr . Darcy bowed . <end>   743.9037317604397
<start> <start> But I can guess how it was ;

 Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she 
 had often great enjoyment out of doors . <end>   995.0843433098053

 principal object . <end>   592.3056078888936

 resentfully , " since we are not to visit . "

 In the evening , soon after Mr . Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw 
 Mr . Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was 
 extreme . <end>   1009.7470101155694
<start> <start> It was next to impossible that their cousin should 
 come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had

 " She will drop the acquaintance entirely . " 
 
 But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this 
 point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley 's being 
 withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which 
 convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely 
 hopeless . <end>   891.7549983649508
<start> <start> You know not what you are 
 about . " 
 
 Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; 
 and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the 
 object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her 
 estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that 
 his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many 
 months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she 
 did conquer her father 's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match . <end>   773.7128529079203
<start> <start> By many significant looks and silent 
 entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of 
 complaisance , - - but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an 
 opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song . <end>   992.1963973750736

 Mr . Darcy 's letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ; and 
 still different from either , was what Mr . Bennet sent to Mr . Collins , in 
 reply to his last . <end>   683.5533523184433
<start> <start> Lydia was 
 occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself 
 in London or Bath ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently 
 staid so long , that even Bingley 's good humour was overcome , and he 
 proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone . <end>   1142.7915510394243
<start> <start> If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him ,

 Catherine 's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . <end>   1059.462513924962

 CHAPTER I . 
 
 
 Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of 
 Pemberley Woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned 
 in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter . <end>   703.716801222761

 child ! <end>   1984.0702180453009
<start> <start> who attended to you ? <end>   842.4387790800179
<start> <start> " I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself - - for I am fond of 
 superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of 
 London would agree with Lady Lucas . " 
 
 He paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to 
 make any ; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was 
 struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to 
 her , 
 
 " My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? - - Mr . Darcy , you must allow 
 me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . - - You 
 cannot refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . " 
 And taking her hand , he would have given it to Mr . Darcy , who , though 
 extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly 
 drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , 
 
 " Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . - - I entreat you 
 not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . " 
 
 Mr . Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her 
 hand ; but in vain . <end>   903.753954063048
<start> <start> Mary , however , continued to console herself with such 
 kind of moral extractions from the evil before them . <end>   1118.2568271442829
<start> <start> yes - - it would be much better to 
 wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter 
 would be at Meryton again . <end>   1202.419891433432

 " And what is your success ? " 
 
 She shook her head . <end>   641.474795250858

 thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of 
 which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit . <end>   879.9085537299338

 himself to have attained it . <end>   632.9897042516003

 squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , 
 are not worth a regret . <end>   747.8978191172245
<start> <start> Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a 
 note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited 
 for an answer . <end>   1024.3153788668376

 of credit . <end>   1282.9821688152301

 at Pemberley , before they left the country . <end>   614.168441813945
<start> <start> " You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr . Bingley , " she added , " for when 
 you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with 
 us , as soon as you returned . <end>   800.042779689655

 my news : it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? <end>   1042.0896390144253

 in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr . Bennet 
 say voluntarily to Elizabeth , 
 
 " I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . " 
 
 Their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the Lucases 
 came to meet Maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects 
 which occupied them ; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , 
 after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs . <end>   1150.255385898077

 there was a motive within her of good will which could not be 
 overlooked . <end>   1052.7390282071644
<start> <start> It does not often happen 
 that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of 
 independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in 
 love with only a few days before . "

 doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea . <end>   725.1619703269846
<start> <start> But it has been the study of 
 my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong 
 understanding to ridicule . " 
 
 " Such as vanity and pride . " 
 
 " Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . <end>   991.8561101132062

<start> <start> " Oh ! <end>   573.2871973670697
<start> <start> But perhaps you have 
 been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case 
 you may be sure of my pardon . " 
 
 " No , " replied Jane , " I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing 
 satisfactory to tell you . <end>   839.7830528497686

<start> <start> Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing 
 how _she_ , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its 
 acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head . <end>   1461.4482562592975
<start> <start> There is no knowing how estates 
 will go when once they come to be entailed . " 
 
 " I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , - - and 
 could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing 
 forward and precipitate . <end>   830.0079213606143
<start> <start> She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to 
 each , to be dwelt on farther . <end>   1040.1979738399473
<start> <start> I came to try you . <end>   627.0222546969849
<start> <start> He 
 had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his 
 wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was 
 paid , she had no knowledge of it . <end>   849.8325986973334
<start> <start> Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing 
 her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with 
 composure . <end>   652.5600171696755
<start> <start> Let Wickham 
 be _your_ man . <end>   1061.9640453316226
<start> <start> Bennet was told of this , she did 
 not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering 
 what her anxiety for his life had been before . <end>   973.9415284710279
<start> <start> But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely 
 they should have opposed their brother 's . <end>   1263.235636848097
<start> <start> He must go 
 somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have 
 nothing to live on . <end>   802.6719217890271
<start> <start> But in an instant arose the 
 dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr . Darcy 's 
 pleasure in the Bingleys 'invitation to the officers ; and though this 
 was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was 
 pronounced by his friend Mr . Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and 
 who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business 
 the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant 
 smile , 
 
 " I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if 
 he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . " 
 
 This part of his intelligence , though unheard by Lydia , was caught by 
 Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for 
 Wickham 's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling 
 of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate 
 disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to 
 the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to 
 make . - - Attention , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was injury to 
 Wickham . <end>   929.3202066786773
<start> <start> Jane 's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , 
 though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that 
 Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . <end>   972.7119672826998
<start> <start> You will not find 
 him more favourably spoken of by any one . " 
 
 " I cannot pretend to be sorry , " said Wickham , after a short 
 interruption , " that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond 
 their deserts ; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen . <end>   778.2398304917691
<start> <start> His circumstances , he 
 assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were 
 exceedingly bad . <end>   863.8265325896748

<start> <start> Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to

 ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very 
 sincerely wish him happy . <end>   1167.78743950907

 leave . <end>   1464.3249587384375

 Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in

<start> <start> There was neither in figure nor face , any

<start> <start> She tried to 
 recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of 
 integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr . 
 Darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those 
 casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Mr . Darcy 
 had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance . <end>   886.0704742431168

 absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . <end>   1491.7389066873498

 time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . "

 begged very hard for a few balls there every winter . <end>   1570.479345433995
<start> <start> To know 
 that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish 
 Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own 
 vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation 
 to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision 
 in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; 
 and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into 
 repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister 
 farther . <end>   842.4911439138564

 world I love , and he is an angel . <end>   514.6882588285079
<start> <start> Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier 
 girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , 
 there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted 
 with all the room ; and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel 
 more beautiful . <end>   750.0218093321987

 mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense 
 of shame was severe . <end>   934.0878817581439

 much . <end>   680.0341818312735

 who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and 
 address most truly the gentleman . <end>   1066.2664294646345
<start> <start> We seem to have been designed for each 
 other . " 
 
 Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was 
 the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed 
 and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . <end>   880.0066445726818

 been always at Longbourn . " 
 
 Elizabeth looked surprised . <end>   710.6826297436568
<start> <start> Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit 
 down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr . Darcy had been 
 standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and 
 Mr . Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his 
 friend to join it . <end>   808.3389948470929
<start> <start> She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and 
 cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing 
 her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly 
 towards him and said , 
 
 " By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at 
 Netherfield ? - - I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult 
 the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not 
 some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a 
 pleasure . " 
 
 " If you mean Darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , 
 before it begins - - but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and 
 as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my 
 cards . " 
 
 " I should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were 
 carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably 
 tedious in the usual process of such a meeting . <end>   980.6767143242454
<start> <start> Will you tell 
 me how long you have loved him ? " 
 
 " It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began . <end>   1076.063613680689
<start> <start> dear Lizzy , only 
 consider what he must have suffered . <end>   1017.8642494960283
<start> <start> Here are officers enough at 
 Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . <end>   1020.3659286208712
<start> <start> Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly . <end>   2576.834643846462

 connection . <end>   866.0374133958064

 in earnest . <end>   573.5929689463724

 ambition will ever be gratified . <end>   728.6968315580008
<start> <start> Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an 
 addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be 
 important . <end>   1154.0583875849761

<start> <start> But , on second thoughts , 
 perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better 
 than any other person . " 
 
 Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for 
 her authority proceeded ; but it was not in her power to give any 
 information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved . <end>   1222.2217203434702

 absent , but had not courage for it . <end>   1193.8789397793494

 This was not very consoling to Mrs . <end>   1024.1979849603367
<start> <start> This was 
 very amiable , but Charlotte 's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth 
 had any conception of ; - - its object was nothing less , than to secure her 
 from any return of Mr . Collins 's addresses , by engaging them towards 
 herself . <end>   891.5508459090904

 them in the course of the day . <end>   692.2618131798405

<start> <start> but from what the report of 
 their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; 
 till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley , 
 and _her_ being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the 
 expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply 
 the idea . <end>   895.0226079400762

 that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than 
 any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of 
 society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for 
 her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . <end>   824.9179571194144

 unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the

 vain for Mr . Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a 
 doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . <end>   872.255399299154

 remains with us . " 
 
 Mrs . <end>   736.769784327129

 circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among 
 hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts . <end>   691.9212524208891
<start> <start> Collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of 
 raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her

 vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power . <end>   1007.0437925181673

 evenings may do a great deal . " 
 
 " Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both 
 like Vingt - un better than Commerce ; but with respect to any other 
 leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . " 
 
 " Well , " said Charlotte , " I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if 
 she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a 
 chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a 
 twelvemonth . <end>   745.1371225142585
<start> <start> His principal object must be , to discover the 
 number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . <end>   1952.5659944445167
<start> <start> Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? " - - And then , with a 
 slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of 
 sight . <end>   855.109489136336
<start> <start> or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? " 
 
 " You take an eager interest in that gentleman 's concerns , " said Darcy in 
 a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . <end>   992.8582309466252
<start> <start> He bore with philosophy the conviction that 
 Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude 
 and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every 
 thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on 
 to make his fortune . <end>   1181.0134432383295
<start> <start> Since such were her 
 feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a 
 marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he 
 easily learnt , had never been _his_ design . <end>   785.1183989055845
<start> <start> Even Elizabeth might have found some 
 trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the 
 improvement of her acquaintance with Mr . Wickham ; and nothing less than 
 a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday and 
 Monday , endurable to Kitty and Lydia . <end>   808.7261638121456
<start> <start> In the desperation 
 of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to 
 Elizabeth , said , 
 
 " Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a 
 turn about the room . - - I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting 
 so long in one attitude . " 
 
 Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . <end>   684.2079723901468
<start> <start> Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs . <end>   458.8282078788977
<start> <start> I wish you had been there , my 
 dear , to have given him one of your set downs . <end>   540.0059168371002
<start> <start> They could 
 not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character 
 from their own feelings , and his servant 's report , without any reference 
 to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , 
 would not have recognised it for Mr . Darcy . <end>   661.4822412422209
<start> <start> She supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what 
 might arise in that quarter . <end>   1363.651611618231
<start> <start> After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss 
 Bingley 's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all 
 attended her into the breakfast parlour . <end>   1216.879453188667
<start> <start> But will they make you happy ? " 
 
 " Have you any other objection , " said Elizabeth , " than your belief of my 
 indifference ? " 
 
 " None at all . <end>   580.2065007433249
<start> <start> Till the next 
 morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her 
 contrivance . <end>   533.1201449790676
<start> <start> Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . " 
 
 Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and 
 Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father 's speech , was afraid 
 her anxiety had done no good . - - Others of the party were now applied to . <end>   657.4758001178386
<start> <start> Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five 
 daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her 
 husband any satisfactory description of Mr . Bingley . <end>   1031.4671890850966
<start> <start> Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer 
 above - mentioned ; and while Mr . Darcy was attending them to their 
 carriage , Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on 
 Elizabeth 's person , behaviour , and dress . <end>   988.6116672667551
<start> <start> Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy 's delight , when she should enter 
 the room . <end>   1454.9575803133375
<start> <start> Anne would have 
 been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . " 
 
 Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his 
 cousin 's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she 
 discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss 
 De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have 
 been just as likely to marry _her_ , had she been his relation . <end>   966.5154037425172
<start> <start> And there was my 
 aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if 
 she was reading a sermon . <end>   824.8588932768977
<start> <start> " John told us Mr . Darcy was 
 here when you sent for us ; - - was it so ? " 
 
 " Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . <end>   756.3033123673862
<start> <start> CHAPTER XII . 
 
 
 Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations 
 which had at length closed her eyes . <end>   581.8471400956807
<start> <start> And one of my 
 own daughters . <end>   617.9556464418272
<start> <start> Bennet ; " and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle 
 directly . " 
 
 The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she 
 would , and the argument ended only with the visit . <end>   811.2428016988744
<start> <start> Long . <end>   732.8678887256858
<start> <start> The insipidity and yet the noise ; the 
 nothingness and yet the self - importance of all these people ! - - What would 
 I give to hear your strictures on them ! " 
 
 " Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . <end>   883.2813436749112
<start> <start> That he was not a good - tempered man , had been her firmest 
 opinion . <end>   662.1803933840914
<start> <start> He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , 
 where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be 
 more prudent . <end>   1225.878423027246
<start> <start> I only hope they may have half my 
 good luck . <end>   1157.2982592616438

 enjoyment like reading ! <end>   1963.8821101041235
<start> <start> Jenkinson , in whose appearance 
 there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening 
 to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before 
 her eyes . <end>   1019.6492344059503

<start> <start> Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and though the mother was 
 found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a 
 wish of being better acquainted with _them_ , was expressed towards the 
 two eldest . <end>   1075.8217159876222
<start> <start> I should be sorry to think so 
 ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . " 
 
 " Ten thousand pounds ! <end>   679.7787086758126
<start> <start> He placed himself by her . <end>   1033.494669043294
<start> <start> Vain , 
 ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled ! <end>   534.8354011127115
<start> <start> He had ruined for a 
 while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart 
 in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have 
 inflicted . <end>   820.9711761778459
<start> <start> Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . " 
 
 She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had 
 intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . <end>   1215.7057844270812
<start> <start> Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows 
 who have been kept aloof by Lydia 's folly . " 
 
 " Indeed you are mistaken . <end>   658.8449890527219
<start> <start> Jenkinson was 
 arranging Miss de Bourgh 's foot - stool , that she said , 'Mr . Collins , you 
 must marry . <end>   473.41492432626404

 dear Lizzy ! <end>   907.9407037743983
<start> <start> She told the story 
 however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , 
 playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous . <end>   1295.8200826605978
<start> <start> A low phaeton , with a nice little 
 pair of ponies , would be the very thing . <end>   785.4853198561949
<start> <start> But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my 
 sister 's absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of 
 pleasure realized . <end>   901.1017779842102
<start> <start> I am very , very sorry . <end>   528.5203702265169
<start> <start> " It keeps him in good 
 humour , " said she , " and I am more obliged to you than I can express . " 
 Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and 
 that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . <end>   666.2262208816145
<start> <start> And if you will stay 
 another _month_ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as 
 far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as 
 Dawson does not object to the Barouche box , there will be very good room 
 for one of you - - and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I 
 should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . " 
 
 " You are all kindness , Madam ; but I believe we must abide by our 
 original plan . " 
 
 Lady Catherine seemed resigned . <end>   865.3087059297304
<start> <start> But no 
 sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had 
 hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered 
 uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . <end>   1090.5483224149464
<start> <start> It was 
 necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on 
 such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs . <end>   965.677894038783
<start> <start> Bennet before breakfast , a 
 conversation beginning with his parsonage - house , and leading naturally 
 to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at 
 Longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general 
 encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on . - - " As to 
 her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say - - she could 
 not positively answer - - but she did not _know_ of any prepossession ; - - her 
 _eldest_ daughter , she must just mention - - she felt it incumbent on her 
 to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . " 
 
 Mr . Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth - - and it was soon 
 done - - done while Mrs . <end>   728.2733086775804

 precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their 
 family . <end>   608.799045330913
<start> <start> I should be sorry , you know , 
 to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   705.8876742283257

 to Oakham Mount this morning . <end>   307.42619516629276
<start> <start> Bennet could not give her consent , or 
 speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , 
 though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when 
 Mr . Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed 
 how really happy he was . <end>   1276.1068625988726
<start> <start> what news ? <end>   1281.2658160815379
<start> <start> But I 
 cannot - - I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly 
 bestowed it most unwillingly . <end>   1029.369859687379
<start> <start> Collins well . " 
 
 " Yes , very well . <end>   331.814371253401
<start> <start> " We 
 can all plague and punish one another . <end>   851.406817290844
<start> <start> " I admire all my three sons - in - law highly , " said he . <end>   699.3071443615968
<start> <start> There was no want of discourse . <end>   1200.556028028943
<start> <start> Without supposing 
 them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference 
 of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she 
 resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left 
 Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such 
 an attachment . <end>   950.4178891649154
<start> <start> I cannot find 
 out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think 
 her a very good sort of girl . <end>   804.4092497298645
<start> <start> " Oh , yes ! - - he was to come there with Wickham , you know . <end>   580.5005860094072
<start> <start> The two girls had been whispering to 
 each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the 
 youngest should tax Mr . Bingley with having promised on his first coming 
 into the country to give a ball at Netherfield . <end>   1160.3662178489483
<start> <start> Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led 
 voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for 
 the world . <end>   1208.0206878758897
<start> <start> But , 
 my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley 
 tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest 
 degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on 
 Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of 
 being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . " 
 
 " If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , " replied Jane , " your 
 representation of all this , might make me quite easy . <end>   895.0381640454403
<start> <start> we had such a good piece 
 of fun the other day at Colonel Forster 's . <end>   1220.7353270905614
<start> <start> My courage always rises with every attempt to 
 intimidate me . " 
 
 " I shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could 
 not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I 
 have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you 
 find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact 
 are not your own . " 
 
 Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to 
 Colonel Fitzwilliam , " Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of 
 me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . <end>   892.148277610561
<start> <start> Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to 
 outstrip them . <end>   476.92792669032735
<start> <start> Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own 
 disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of 
 such an enormity , at so early an age . <end>   797.0665319557176
<start> <start> In Lydia 's imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised 
 every possibility of earthly happiness . <end>   1042.94376909666
<start> <start> The 
 eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty - seven , 
 was Elizabeth 's intimate friend . <end>   1138.7775469502624
<start> <start> Their table was superlatively stupid . <end>   566.180472197792

 mistaken . <end>   1029.9478446630249
<start> <start> " Your friend performs delightfully ; " he 
 continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; - - " and I doubt 
 not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Mr . Darcy . " 
 
 " You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Sir . " 
 
 " Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight . <end>   585.5317109293238
<start> <start> Bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and 
 she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and 
 having very frequent parties at home . <end>   801.5383190213929
<start> <start> " Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; I thought it would never 
 be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt 
 were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . <end>   795.7690719197847

 doing very well together . <end>   732.5608138809047

 Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets 
 were particularly intimate . <end>   1140.4587979922162
<start> <start> " And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters 
 behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the 
 winter is over . " 
 
 " I thank you for my share of the favour , " said Elizabeth ; " but I do not 
 particularly like your way of getting husbands . " 
 
 Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . <end>   1096.0880186467452
<start> <start> The supposition did not pain her . <end>   1396.0181498533725
<start> <start> But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the 
 good - natured wishes for her well - doing , which had proceeded before , from 
 all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit 
 in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her 
 misery was considered certain . <end>   938.0001707195203

 him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good 
 cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen . <end>   555.4271301235452
<start> <start> He immediately offered to fetch her 
 others ; all that his library afforded . <end>   1081.8797830422873
<start> <start> It was to be such a secret ! "

 subject . <end>   583.5710653005659

 the delight of Mrs . <end>   397.43857786624767
<start> <start> Mr . Collins was carefully instructing them in 
 what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many 
 servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them . <end>   728.2725463555989
<start> <start> dear , yes ; - - but you must own she is very plain . <end>   843.9302676122762
<start> <start> I will read it to you - - 
 
 " When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which 
 took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we 
 are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when 
 Charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have 
 determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend 
 his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel . <end>   970.0552481751109
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   243.39116572125704
<start> <start> Your superior knowledge of your sister must make 
 the latter probable . - - If it be so , if I have been misled by such 
 error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been 
 unreasonable . <end>   910.7371796571313
<start> <start> " But it is fortunate , " thought she , " that I have something to wish for . <end>   481.50765818241797
<start> <start> They went to the library , 
 therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to 
 make it known to her . <end>   641.5300148383569
<start> <start> Almost as 
 soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my 
 future life . <end>   650.3991857946705
<start> <start> Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and 
 good conduct , I am sure . <end>   1497.610466436511
<start> <start> We had better go into the 
 avenue . " 
 
 But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , 
 laughingly answered , 
 
 " No , no ; stay where you are . - - You are charmingly group 'd , and appear to 
 uncommon advantage . <end>   532.3007282334395
<start> <start> This cannot be ! <end>   1142.8537311489463
<start> <start> Well , he is a 
 very undeserving young man - - and I do not suppose there is the least 
 chance in the world of her ever getting him now . <end>   756.2664369090386
<start> <start> They saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now 
 added that of general unreserve . <end>   539.6357491413995
<start> <start> By this time she is 
 actually with them ! <end>   1174.846233468288
<start> <start> His affection for 
 her soon sunk into indifference ; her 's lasted a little longer ; and in 
 spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to 
 reputation which her marriage had given her . <end>   1109.4472442886695
<start> <start> What a contrast between him and his friend ! <end>   1637.0350203535108
<start> <start> I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty , but 
 I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now . <end>   940.8891803907109
<start> <start> Indeed , Eliza , you will be 
 as welcome to me as either of them . " 
 
 The wedding took place ; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from 
 the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the 
 subject as usual . <end>   916.5794284950829
<start> <start> " It must not be thought of . <end>   439.4876795013933
<start> <start> There , shut into her own room , 
 as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption 
 of all that she had heard . <end>   950.9912606609363

 can be no occasion for your going so soon . <end>   1011.2237921043023
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   243.39116572125704
<start> <start> In that case he would return no more . <end>   1145.8662634925565
<start> <start> She had high 
 animal spirits , and a sort of natural self - consequence , which the 
 attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle 's good dinners and her own 
 easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance . <end>   958.3998009376918
<start> <start> Though I 
 shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if I was 
 her , I would not have put up with it . <end>   869.4990586617708
<start> <start> The moment of her release from 
 him was ecstacy . <end>   323.45441805162443
<start> <start> It is from my cousin , Mr . Collins , who , when I am dead ,

 brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant 's
