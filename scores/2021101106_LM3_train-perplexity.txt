 Stately , plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead , bearing a bowl of 
 lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed . <end>   3.2732553311698585
<start> <start> A yellow 
 dressinggown , ungirdled , was sustained gently behind him on the mild 
 morning air . <end>   4.759177549758819
<start> <start> He held the bowl aloft and intoned : 
 
 _Introibo ad altare Dei_ . <end>   3.5229349534285648
<start> <start> Halted , he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely : 
 
 Come up , Kinch ! <end>   6.922144263040923
<start> <start> Come up , you fearful jesuit ! <end>   11.305052062377962
<start> <start> Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest . <end>   5.778292617525376
<start> <start> He faced about 
 and blessed gravely thrice the tower , the surrounding land and the 
 awaking mountains . <end>   6.425991018788032
<start> <start> Then , catching sight of Stephen Dedalus , he bent 
 towards him and made rapid crosses in the air , gurgling in his throat 
 and shaking his head . <end>   6.434255977958234
<start> <start> Stephen Dedalus , displeased and sleepy , leaned 
 his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking 
 gurgling face that blessed him , equine in its length , and at the light 
 untonsured hair , grained and hued like pale oak . <end>   4.234027202888531
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the 
 bowl smartly . <end>   7.298302817755155
<start> <start> Back to barracks ! <end>   7.614982061692208
<start> <start> he said sternly . <end>   12.157671634065597
<start> <start> He added in a preacher s tone : 
 
 For this , O dearly beloved , is the genuine Christine : body and soul 
 and blood and ouns . <end>   4.813990496552162
<start> <start> Slow music , please . <end>   9.208664598254153
<start> <start> Shut your eyes , gents . <end>   8.377610912866668
<start> <start> One 
 moment . <end>   7.857044550474274
<start> <start> A little trouble about those white corpuscles . <end>   3.8392068764822707
<start> <start> Silence , all . <end>   14.664967671107089
<start> <start> He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call , then paused 
 awhile in rapt attention , his even white teeth glistening here and 
 there with gold points . <end>   4.476108873679506
<start> <start> Chrysostomos . <end>   35.49369557982899
<start> <start> Two strong shrill whistles 
 answered through the calm . <end>   4.663295438855962
<start> <start> Thanks , old chap , he cried briskly . <end>   7.485409997973538
<start> <start> That will do nicely . <end>   6.277054571820356
<start> <start> Switch off 
 the current , will you ? <end>   7.460323454269695
<start> <start> He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher , gathering 
 about his legs the loose folds of his gown . <end>   4.7707774953546425
<start> <start> The plump shadowed face and 
 sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate , patron of arts in the middle ages . <end>   3.5303767284644416
<start> <start> A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips . <end>   3.6374347685916097
<start> <start> The mockery of it ! <end>   8.235772559961596
<start> <start> he said gaily . <end>   13.965497406645268
<start> <start> Your absurd name , an ancient Greek ! <end>   7.378320172222279
<start> <start> He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet , 
 laughing to himself . <end>   5.80575123510285
<start> <start> Stephen Dedalus stepped up , followed him wearily 
 halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest , watching him still as 
 he propped his mirror on the parapet , dipped the brush in the bowl and 
 lathered cheeks and neck . <end>   4.522286154144892
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan s gay voice went on . <end>   4.382339903214472
<start> <start> My name is absurd too : Malachi Mulligan , two dactyls . <end>   6.127710345895051
<start> <start> But it has a 
 Hellenic ring , hasn t it ? <end>   5.46788281131808
<start> <start> Tripping and sunny like the buck himself . <end>   6.4761190130010355
<start> <start> We 
 must go to Athens . <end>   8.821406416390861
<start> <start> Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out 
 twenty quid ? <end>   4.350933784702526
<start> <start> He laid the brush aside and , laughing with delight , cried : 
 
 Will he come ? <end>   6.165681639099699
<start> <start> The jejune jesuit ! <end>   7.567558896500215
<start> <start> Ceasing , he began to shave with care . <end>   8.383215798817535
<start> <start> Tell me , Mulligan , Stephen said quietly . <end>   10.50809932501316
<start> <start> Yes , my love ? <end>   11.875023361011422
<start> <start> How long is Haines going to stay in this tower ? <end>   4.884243800426864
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder . <end>   4.529892428893327
<start> <start> God , isn t he dreadful ? <end>   8.232178375582183
<start> <start> he said frankly . <end>   12.157671634065597
<start> <start> A ponderous Saxon . <end>   7.441109318688844
<start> <start> He thinks 
 you re not a gentleman . <end>   7.643733844175798
<start> <start> God , these bloody English ! <end>   5.978474197556571
<start> <start> Bursting with money 
 and indigestion . <end>   9.366888083826394
<start> <start> Because he comes from Oxford . <end>   7.169255049832616
<start> <start> You know , Dedalus , you 
 have the real Oxford manner . <end>   9.251502504343504
<start> <start> He can t make you out . <end>   9.007451169440008
<start> <start> O , my name for you 
 is the best : Kinch , the knife - blade . <end>   9.338914887416976
<start> <start> He shaved warily over his chin . <end>   5.880563963918734
<start> <start> He was raving all night about a black panther , Stephen said . <end>   4.3987548055743355
<start> <start> Where is 
 his guncase ? <end>   14.054406385648328
<start> <start> A woful lunatic ! <end>   7.441109318688844
<start> <start> Mulligan said . <end>   10.320656725725573
<start> <start> Were you in a funk ? <end>   10.91600399503745
<start> <start> I was , Stephen said with energy and growing fear . <end>   5.394187187522178
<start> <start> Out here in the dark 
 with a man I don t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a 
 black panther . <end>   6.571141829081536
<start> <start> You saved men from drowning . <end>   5.09559502772162
<start> <start> I m not a hero , however . <end>   5.765402383311215
<start> <start> If 
 he stays on here I am off . <end>   7.244278411876568
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade . <end>   8.789599448017984
<start> <start> He hopped down 
 from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily . <end>   4.26610881155455
<start> <start> Scutter ! <end>   35.49369557982899
<start> <start> he cried thickly . <end>   8.469391628640716
<start> <start> Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a 
 dirty crumpled handkerchief . <end>   5.827847169966829
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly . <end>   3.7498472294830796
<start> <start> Then , gazing over the handkerchief , he said : 
 
 The bard s noserag ! <end>   5.131813216059263
<start> <start> A new art colour for our Irish poets : snotgreen . <end>   3.108962704663118
<start> <start> You can almost taste it , can t you ? <end>   8.21676300790791
<start> <start> He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay , his fair 
 oakpale hair stirring slightly . <end>   4.606825736407786
<start> <start> God ! <end>   18.445266252337873
<start> <start> he said quietly . <end>   11.4091389200177
<start> <start> Isn t the sea what Algy calls it : a great sweet 
 mother ? <end>   8.446125104379895
<start> <start> The snotgreen sea . <end>   7.597360795401087
<start> <start> The scrotumtightening sea . <end>   7.597360795401087
<start> <start> _Epi oinopa 
 ponton_ . <end>   5.603694261385779
<start> <start> Ah , Dedalus , the Greeks ! <end>   18.485460671886504
<start> <start> I must teach you . <end>   6.7311510737359415
<start> <start> You must read them 
 in the original . <end>   8.647956116223737
<start> <start> _Thalatta ! <end>   35.49369557982899
<start> <start> Thalatta ! _ She is our great sweet mother . <end>   7.344188518501928
<start> <start> Come and look . <end>   10.879038352576769
<start> <start> Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet . <end>   7.157954215687035
<start> <start> Leaning on it he looked 
 down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of 
 Kingstown . <end>   7.82850522932982
<start> <start> Our mighty mother ! <end>   8.480404030097503
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan said . <end>   4.311219261582355
<start> <start> He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen s 
 face . <end>   6.204322682944544
<start> <start> The aunt thinks you killed your mother , he said . <end>   3.671072323793998
<start> <start> That s why she won t 
 let me have anything to do with you . <end>   4.439729544534797
<start> <start> Someone killed her , Stephen said gloomily . <end>   10.502478852792676
<start> <start> You could have knelt down , damn it , Kinch , when your dying mother 
 asked you , Buck Mulligan said . <end>   6.088440719674761
<start> <start> I m hyperborean as much as you . <end>   5.9625093159017055
<start> <start> But to 
 think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and 
 pray for her . <end>   7.6934930985393235
<start> <start> And you refused . <end>   7.1957573265461985
<start> <start> There is something sinister in you . . . . <end>   4.918750250420295
<start> <start> He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek . <end>   2.949204443741812
<start> <start> A tolerant 
 smile curled his lips . <end>   3.5349142410500867
<start> <start> But a lovely mummer ! <end>   7.210613422010863
<start> <start> he murmured to himself . <end>   7.8826114228929995
<start> <start> Kinch , the loveliest 
 mummer of them all ! <end>   7.848323404775261
<start> <start> He shaved evenly and with care , in silence , seriously . <end>   6.553523329783171
<start> <start> Pain , that was not yet the pain of love , fretted his heart . <end>   5.675655844066941
<start> <start> Silently , 
 in a dream she had come to him after her death , her wasted body within 
 its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood , 
 her breath , that had bent upon him , mute , reproachful , a faint odour of 
 wetted ashes . <end>   5.629540709006927
<start> <start> Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a 
 great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him . <end>   4.816173434532222
<start> <start> The ring of bay and 
 skyline held a dull green mass of liquid . <end>   4.436626820590434
<start> <start> A bowl of white china had 
 stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had 
 torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting . <end>   3.431191950290514
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade . <end>   4.585480229133693
<start> <start> Ah , poor dogsbody ! <end>   9.459093295761697
<start> <start> I must give you a shirt 
 and a few noserags . <end>   8.537495251363964
<start> <start> How are the secondhand breeks ? <end>   6.300581474766953
<start> <start> They fit well enough , Stephen answered . <end>   6.435191702965228
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip . <end>   4.02971717337502
<start> <start> The mockery of it , he said contentedly . <end>   8.325143966116164
<start> <start> Secondleg they should be . <end>   10.389576806931352
<start> <start> God 
 knows what poxy bowsy left them off . <end>   4.346052049173739
<start> <start> I have a lovely pair with a hair 
 stripe , grey . <end>   5.805425923255297
<start> <start> You ll look spiffing in them . <end>   5.212349948576287
<start> <start> I m not joking , Kinch . <end>   4.23489695241221
<start> <start> You 
 look damn well when you re dressed . <end>   5.6469318725637585
<start> <start> Thanks , Stephen said . <end>   6.554389710049974
<start> <start> I can t wear them if they are grey . <end>   5.382765007576137
<start> <start> He can t wear them , Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror . <end>   7.879195164304274
<start> <start> Etiquette is etiquette . <end>   8.513158751427794
<start> <start> He kills his mother but he can t wear grey 
 trousers . <end>   5.582937847518642
<start> <start> He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the 
 smooth skin . <end>   3.744128038402309
<start> <start> Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its 
 smokeblue mobile eyes . <end>   6.241918499380898
<start> <start> That fellow I was with in the Ship last night , said Buck Mulligan , 
 says you have g . <end>   9.768767338428894
<start> <start> i . <end>   55.81314716524236
<start> <start> He s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman . <end>   5.199185013324894
<start> <start> General paralysis of the insane ! <end>   12.507206446443131
<start> <start> He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings 
 abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea . <end>   3.828483007092099
<start> <start> His curling shaven lips 
 laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth . <end>   5.740566715294886
<start> <start> Laughter seized 
 all his strong wellknit trunk . <end>   5.546588723365526
<start> <start> Look at yourself , he said , you dreadful bard ! <end>   6.642569677302084
<start> <start> Hair on end . <end>   9.307507555397333
<start> <start> As he and others see me . <end>   6.28766862994957
<start> <start> Who chose this 
 face for me ? <end>   8.46074382063291
<start> <start> This dogsbody to rid of vermin . <end>   4.26698125860711
<start> <start> It asks me too . <end>   8.919298893584953
<start> <start> I pinched it out of the skivvy s room , Buck Mulligan said . <end>   4.91148936506025
<start> <start> It does her 
 all right . <end>   10.102199085174288
<start> <start> The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi . <end>   2.643086690752848
<start> <start> Lead him not into temptation . <end>   6.213887384799345
<start> <start> And her name is Ursula . <end>   8.319386304870013
<start> <start> Laughing again , he brought the mirror away from Stephen s peering eyes . <end>   8.730822268904339
<start> <start> The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror , he said . <end>   4.1403690959581265
<start> <start> If 
 Wilde were only alive to see you ! <end>   4.550265826407985
<start> <start> Drawing back and pointing , Stephen said with bitterness : 
 
 It is a symbol of Irish art . <end>   5.535130386066918
<start> <start> The cracked lookingglass of a servant . <end>   6.407905698519982
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen s and walked with him 
 round the tower , his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he 
 had thrust them . <end>   5.4880692469348125
<start> <start> It s not fair to tease you like that , Kinch , is it ? <end>   6.090156363954038
<start> <start> he said kindly . <end>   9.833836801445267
<start> <start> God knows you have more spirit than any of them . <end>   6.058262023188919
<start> <start> Parried again . <end>   15.074803869197973
<start> <start> He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his . <end>   5.808788679294403
<start> <start> The 
 cold steel pen . <end>   5.553253988538818
<start> <start> Cracked lookingglass of a servant ! <end>   10.575271116102277
<start> <start> Tell that to the oxy chap 
 downstairs and touch him for a guinea . <end>   6.377859980137625
<start> <start> He s stinking with money and 
 thinks you re not a gentleman . <end>   6.362171866934235
<start> <start> His old fellow made his tin by selling 
 jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other . <end>   2.7867052518742557
<start> <start> Hellenise it . <end>   14.560791591306039
<start> <start> Cranly s arm . <end>   8.1371567673489
<start> <start> His arm . <end>   11.72287444147153
<start> <start> And to think of your having to beg from these swine . <end>   4.464651163241676

<start> <start> He had spoken himself into boldness . <end>   3.767578961262139
<start> <start> Stephen , shielding the gaping 
 wounds which the words had left in his heart , said very coldly : 
 
 I am not thinking of the offence to my mother . <end>   6.1967413976879415
<start> <start> Of what then ? <end>   7.06842217774262

 felt the fever of his cheeks . <end>   5.794312435963031
<start> <start> A voice within the tower called loudly : 
 
 Are you up there , Mulligan ? <end>   6.240734077029781
<start> <start> I m coming , Buck Mulligan answered . <end>   5.24983687948156

 from the high barbacans : and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of

<start> <start> I want Sandycove 
 milk . <end>   6.177073285204855
<start> <start> Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly : 
 
 That woman is coming up with the milk . <end>   8.741310014429555
<start> <start> The blessings of God on you ! <end>   8.639962586945405

<start> <start> Here , 
 I can t go fumbling at the damned eggs . <end>   9.47587829092981
<start> <start> He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three 
 plates , saying : 
 
 _In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti . _ 
 
 Haines sat down to pour out the tea . <end>   4.051454482906076
<start> <start> I m giving you two lumps each , he said . <end>   3.8752990734746042
<start> <start> But , I say , Mulligan , you do 
 make strong tea , don t you ? <end>   7.799027774102014
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan , hewing thick slices from the loaf , said in an old 
 woman s wheedling voice : 
 
 When I makes tea I makes tea , as old mother Grogan said . <end>   5.197412296196546
<start> <start> And when I 
 makes water I makes water . <end>   7.131336852726399
<start> <start> By Jove , it is tea , Haines said . <end>   7.2913125713798035
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling : 
 
 _So I do , Mrs Cahill , _ says she . <end>   4.986347036925753
<start> <start> _Begob , ma am , _ says Mrs Cahill , _God

 He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread , impaled 
 on his knife . <end>   4.354700074558212
<start> <start> That s folk , he said very earnestly , for your book , Haines . <end>   7.303218928763086

<start> <start> Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind . <end>   10.624122562634447
<start> <start> He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice , lifting his 
 brows : 
 
 Can you recall , brother , is mother Grogan s tea and water pot spoken 
 of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads ? <end>   6.336642182380728
<start> <start> I doubt it , said Stephen gravely . <end>   10.379111715400784
<start> <start> Do you now ? <end>   8.472494045982309
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan said in the same tone . <end>   12.567463425115728
<start> <start> Your reasons , pray ? <end>   9.609271958910274
<start> <start> I fancy , Stephen said as he ate , it did not exist in or out of the 
 Mabinogion . <end>   6.902204399346768
<start> <start> Mother Grogan was , one imagines , a kinswoman of Mary Ann . <end>   7.290684616849458
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan s face smiled with delight . <end>   5.855736668187703
<start> <start> Charming ! <end>   31.40138937508791
<start> <start> he said in a finical sweet voice , showing his white teeth 
 and blinking his eyes pleasantly . <end>   7.032217979644232
<start> <start> Do you think she was ? <end>   9.620365898810135
<start> <start> Quite charming ! <end>   12.906051580053969
<start> <start> Then , suddenly overclouding all his features , he growled in a hoarsened 
 rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf : 
 
 _ For old Mary Ann 
 
 She doesn t care a damn . <end>   4.956241188874624
<start> <start> But , hising up her petticoats . . . _ 
 
 He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned . <end>   3.5986736059639495
<start> <start> The doorway was darkened by an entering form . <end>   3.8379768004260018

<start> <start> Kinch , get the jug . <end>   11.804095938770457
<start> <start> An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen s elbow . <end>   7.498185981917501
<start> <start> That s a lovely morning , sir , she said . <end>   5.163001377605091
<start> <start> Glory be to God . <end>   7.251314137670977
<start> <start> To whom ? <end>   11.008599502501479
<start> <start> Mulligan said , glancing at her . <end>   11.09014026967939
<start> <start> Ah , to be sure ! <end>   14.540936894075744
<start> <start> Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker . <end>   8.411914882819502

 the collector of prepuces . <end>   4.592544250574508
<start> <start> How much , sir ? <end>   9.879618476301705
<start> <start> asked the old woman . <end>   13.321849315113338
<start> <start> A quart , Stephen said . <end>   5.219981014464006
<start> <start> He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white 
 milk , not hers . <end>   4.742624535745119

<start> <start> She poured again a measureful and a 
 tilly . <end>   5.6360895833389675
<start> <start> Old and secret she had entered from a morning world , maybe a 
 messenger . <end>   5.4589130289599215
<start> <start> She praised the goodness of the milk , pouring it out . <end>   7.439575670439204
<start> <start> Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field , a witch on 
 her toadstool , her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs . <end>   5.582933012041884

<start> <start> It is indeed , ma am , Buck Mulligan said , pouring milk into their cups . <end>   4.30630817224874
<start> <start> Taste it , sir , she said . <end>   8.03443136821655
<start> <start> He drank at her bidding . <end>   6.714685582605763
<start> <start> If we could live on good food like that , he said to her somewhat 
 loudly , we wouldn t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten 
 guts . <end>   4.522564297401077

<start> <start> Are you a medical student , sir ? <end>   5.550250259170068

<start> <start> I am , ma am , Buck Mulligan answered . <end>   4.2218912795702686
<start> <start> Look at that now , she said . <end>   8.013931219679478
<start> <start> Stephen listened in scornful silence . <end>   4.799633187812574
<start> <start> She bows her old head to a voice 
 that speaks to her loudly , her bonesetter , her medicineman : me she 
 slights . <end>   6.143345424251423
<start> <start> To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there 
 is of her but her woman s unclean loins , of man s flesh made not in 
 God s likeness , the serpent s prey . <end>   6.061162524190343
<start> <start> And to the loud voice that now bids 
 her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes . <end>   4.498960109048058
<start> <start> Do you understand what he says ? <end>   9.03937901013123
<start> <start> Stephen asked her . <end>   9.061400483790152
<start> <start> Is it French you are talking , sir ? <end>   5.085325467284424
<start> <start> the old woman said to Haines . <end>   8.154100585286253
<start> <start> Haines spoke to her again a longer speech , confidently . <end>   5.266067645980208

<start> <start> Is there Gaelic on you ? <end>   6.075069816197504
<start> <start> I thought it was Irish , she said , by the sound of it . <end>   8.89826991947744
<start> <start> Are you from the 
 west , sir ? <end>   10.93725158482643
<start> <start> I am an Englishman , Haines answered . <end>   5.679183397462572
<start> <start> He s English , Buck Mulligan said , and he thinks we ought to speak 
 Irish in Ireland . <end>   5.4371708792774225
<start> <start> Sure we ought to , the old woman said , and I m ashamed I don t speak 
 the language myself . <end>   9.194351226637753
<start> <start> I m told it s a grand language by them that knows . <end>   5.633985990160212
<start> <start> Grand is no name for it , said Buck Mulligan . <end>   12.94697606417666
<start> <start> Wonderful entirely . <end>   12.242048808076966
<start> <start> Fill

<start> <start> Would you like a cup , ma am ? <end>   7.086701630342533
<start> <start> No , thank you , sir , the old woman said , slipping the ring of the 
 milkcan on her forearm and about to go . <end>   5.8342342365130255
<start> <start> Haines said to her : 
 
 Have you your bill ? <end>   10.319619916958453
<start> <start> We had better pay her , Mulligan , hadn t we ? <end>   5.800663662528861
<start> <start> Stephen filled again the three cups . <end>   6.252581175882434
<start> <start> Bill , sir ? <end>   12.41597568211997
<start> <start> she said , halting . <end>   13.781480736173851
<start> <start> Well , it s seven mornings a pint at 
 twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three 
 mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling . <end>   3.2633035000500206
<start> <start> That s a 
 shilling and one and two is two and two , sir . <end>   5.5172601571233635
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan sighed and , having filled his mouth with a crust thickly 
 buttered on both sides , stretched forth his legs and began to search 
 his trouser pockets . <end>   4.137157323728518
<start> <start> Pay up and look pleasant , Haines said to him , smiling . <end>   7.460308108558679
<start> <start> Stephen filled a third cup , a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the 
 thick rich milk . <end>   5.242847953048991
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan brought up a florin , twisted it round in 
 his fingers and cried : 
 
 A miracle ! <end>   5.668961940725734
<start> <start> He passed it along the table towards the old woman , saying : 
 
 Ask nothing more of me , sweet . <end>   7.505103771087803
<start> <start> All I can give you I give . <end>   8.398672494192725
<start> <start> Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand . <end>   5.906121290678651
<start> <start> We ll owe twopence , he said . <end>   3.494166925054405
<start> <start> Time enough , sir , she said , taking the coin . <end>   6.834200775072691

<start> <start> Good 
 morning , sir . <end>   6.503411104125279
<start> <start> She curtseyed and went out , followed by Buck Mulligan s tender chant : 
 
 _ Heart of my heart , were it more , 
 
 More would be laid at your feet . _ 
 
 He turned to Stephen and said : 
 
 Seriously , Dedalus . <end>   6.167883642735131
<start> <start> I m stony . <end>   8.86796767995896
<start> <start> Hurry out to your school kip and bring 
 us back some money . <end>   4.735895071275521
<start> <start> Today the bards must drink and junket . <end>   4.100355631197592
<start> <start> Ireland 
 expects that every man this day will do his duty . <end>   4.603999368194858
<start> <start> That reminds me , Haines said , rising , that I have to visit your 
 national library today . <end>   7.714865767743134
<start> <start> Our swim first , Buck Mulligan said . <end>   4.800273538266679
<start> <start> He turned to Stephen and asked blandly : 
 
 Is this the day for your monthly wash , Kinch ? <end>   4.5249907188304945
<start> <start> Then he said to Haines : 
 
 The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month . <end>   4.947771990133375
<start> <start> All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream , Stephen said as he let honey 
 trickle over a slice of the loaf . <end>   5.251265722099366
<start> <start> Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the 
 loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke : 
 
 I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me . <end>   6.213309726066689
<start> <start> Speaking to me . <end>   8.691400141334528
<start> <start> They wash and tub and scrub . <end>   4.2730806649133575

<start> <start> Conscience . <end>   35.49369557982899
<start> <start> Yet here s a spot . <end>   10.064442636474762
<start> <start> That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol 
 of Irish art is deuced good . <end>   4.829675011824593
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen s foot under the table and said with 
 warmth of tone : 
 
 Wait till you hear him on Hamlet , Haines . <end>   6.6844214429383095
<start> <start> Well , I mean it , Haines said , still speaking to Stephen . <end>   8.379609256833657
<start> <start> I was just 
 thinking of it when that poor old creature came in . <end>   5.754204820600949
<start> <start> Would I make any money by it ? <end>   4.018042652599268
<start> <start> Stephen asked . <end>   6.937058685218552
<start> <start> Haines laughed and , as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of 
 the hammock , said : 
 
 I don t know , I m sure . <end>   6.919007522510605
<start> <start> He strolled out to the doorway . <end>   9.271156733561376
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen 
 and said with coarse vigour : 
 
 You put your hoof in it now . <end>   5.38758909822314
<start> <start> Well ? <end>   15.691733836444966
<start> <start> Stephen said . <end>   9.308921811360753
<start> <start> The problem is to get money . <end>   11.1061887788273
<start> <start> From whom ? <end>   13.130018970166146
<start> <start> From the 
 milkwoman or from him . <end>   7.413878827082012
<start> <start> It s a toss up , I think . <end>   5.978266802382546
<start> <start> I blow him out about you , Buck Mulligan said , and then you come along 
 with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes . <end>   5.239619054130802
<start> <start> I see little hope , Stephen said , from her or from him . <end>   7.41957871279013
<start> <start> From me , Kinch , he said . <end>   8.481901424928067
<start> <start> In a suddenly changed tone he added : 
 
 To tell you the God s truth I think you re right . <end>   5.51971998969904
<start> <start> Damn all else they 
 are good for . <end>   6.838830465890558
<start> <start> Why don t you play them as I do ? <end>   8.384657779087394
<start> <start> To hell with them all . <end>   6.927052385988432
<start> <start> Let us get out of the kip . <end>   8.761947775055114
<start> <start> He stood up , gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown , saying 
 resignedly : 
 
 Mulligan is stripped of his garments . <end>   4.7988109820852065
<start> <start> He emptied his pockets on to the table . <end>   5.808085700951196
<start> <start> There s your snotrag , he said . <end>   4.580666383395889
<start> <start> And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them , 
 chiding them , and to his dangling watchchain . <end>   7.173890008148635
<start> <start> His hands plunged and 
 rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief . <end>   6.252778103465924
<start> <start> God , 
 we ll simply have to dress the character . <end>   6.644284961048964

 boots . <end>   4.845062083551621
<start> <start> Contradiction . <end>   35.49369557982899
<start> <start> Do I contradict myself ? <end>   6.4985858072718425
<start> <start> Very well then , I 
 contradict myself . <end>   10.486183236026976
<start> <start> Mercurial Malachi . <end>   14.541640879995175
<start> <start> A limp black missile flew out of 
 his talking hands . <end>   5.081014196946382
<start> <start> And there s your Latin quarter hat , he said . <end>   4.826003091008675
<start> <start> Stephen picked it up and put it on . <end>   9.493472913003865
<start> <start> Haines called to them from the 
 doorway : 
 
 Are you coming , you fellows ? <end>   8.793725846686032
<start> <start> I m ready , Buck Mulligan answered , going towards the door . <end>   5.792488286344736
<start> <start> Come out , 
 Kinch . <end>   14.957772214512133
<start> <start> You have eaten all we left , I suppose . <end>   6.097417541518311
<start> <start> Resigned he passed out 
 with grave words and gait , saying , wellnigh with sorrow : 
 
 And going forth he met Butterly . <end>   3.948190039994497
<start> <start> Stephen , taking his ashplant from its leaningplace , followed them out 
 and , as they went down the ladder , pulled to the slow iron door and 
 locked it . <end>   5.8162467221204315
<start> <start> He put the huge key in his inner pocket . <end>   5.810010878857499
<start> <start> At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked : 
 
 Did you bring the key ? <end>   6.945054508742145
<start> <start> I have it , Stephen said , preceding them . <end>   6.160922706283641
<start> <start> He walked on . <end>   6.111967617108721
<start> <start> Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy 
 bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses . <end>   4.099216086435081
<start> <start> Down , sir ! <end>   14.222718302320432
<start> <start> How dare you , sir ! <end>   10.194306454250293
<start> <start> Haines asked : 
 
 Do you pay rent for this tower ? <end>   4.83805478171738
<start> <start> To the secretary of state for war , Stephen added over his shoulder . <end>   3.9797318059844513
<start> <start> They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last : 
 
 Rather bleak in wintertime , I should say . <end>   4.175895510954585
<start> <start> Martello you call it ? <end>   9.695039410602154
<start> <start> Billy Pitt had them built , Buck Mulligan said , when the French were on 
 the sea . <end>   4.995815736578698
<start> <start> But ours is the _omphalos_ . <end>   8.766728589289663
<start> <start> What is your idea of Hamlet ? <end>   5.324323195975245
<start> <start> Haines asked Stephen . <end>   7.740462702364322
<start> <start> No , no , Buck Mulligan shouted in pain . <end>   5.145408397422289
<start> <start> I m not equal to Thomas Aquinas 
 and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up . <end>   4.604170810380917
<start> <start> Wait till I 
 have a few pints in me first . <end>   7.943426633401343
<start> <start> He turned to Stephen , saying , as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his 
 primrose waistcoat : 
 
 You couldn t manage it under three pints , Kinch , could you ? <end>   4.551862514251821
<start> <start> It has waited so long , Stephen said listlessly , it can wait longer . <end>   4.921065425665776
<start> <start> You pique my curiosity , Haines said amiably . <end>   4.426699222180674
<start> <start> Is it some paradox ? <end>   6.1762964584889355
<start> <start> Pooh ! <end>   24.923299263638793
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan said . <end>   4.311219261582355
<start> <start> It s quite simple . <end>   7.130060457283205
<start> <start> He proves by algebra that Hamlet s grandson is 
 Shakespeare s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own 
 father . <end>   5.196783220193526
<start> <start> What ? <end>   7.275240556106635
<start> <start> Haines said , beginning to point at Stephen . <end>   8.991666739899172
<start> <start> He himself ? <end>   12.292615635343472
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and , bending in 
 loose laughter , said to Stephen s ear : 
 
 O , shade of Kinch the elder ! <end>   5.789726985663502
<start> <start> Japhet in search of a father ! <end>   11.490943103181637
<start> <start> We re always tired in the morning , Stephen said to Haines . <end>   7.7803617370640685
<start> <start> And it is 
 rather long to tell . <end>   9.425541371132056
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan , walking forward again , raised his hands . <end>   6.459722082262558
<start> <start> The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus , he said . <end>   2.615076149471027
<start> <start> I mean to say , Haines explained to Stephen as they followed , this 
 tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore . <end>   4.252189200313376
<start> <start> _That 
 beetles o er his base into the sea , _ isn t it ? <end>   4.654195746569728
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did 
 not speak . <end>   4.7788126035187455
<start> <start> In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in 
 cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires . <end>   3.8827824486325038
<start> <start> It s a wonderful tale , Haines said , bringing them to halt again . <end>   4.597133753824725
<start> <start> Eyes , pale as the sea the wind had freshened , paler , firm and prudent . <end>   3.5822230021415558
<start> <start> I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere , he said bemused . <end>   6.788762170412941
<start> <start> The Father and the Son idea . <end>   9.244143896796169
<start> <start> The Son striving to be atoned with the 
 Father . <end>   9.995095111358435
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face . <end>   5.718779972376659
<start> <start> He looked 
 at them , his wellshaped mouth open happily , his eyes , from which he had 
 suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense , blinking with mad gaiety . <end>   4.450966224513497
<start> <start> He moved 
 a doll s head to and fro , the brims of his Panama hat quivering , and 
 began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice : 
 
 _ I m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard . <end>   5.507242221198601
<start> <start> My mother s a jew , my father s a bird . <end>   12.673177504686583
<start> <start> With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree . <end>   4.146158048529914
<start> <start> So here s to disciples and Calvary . _ 
 
 He held up a forefinger of warning . <end>   5.175399556639036
<start> <start> _ If anyone thinks that I amn t divine 
 He ll get no free drinks when I m making the wine 
 But have to drink water and wish it were plain 
 That I make when the wine becomes water again . _ 
 
 He tugged swiftly at Stephen s ashplant in farewell and , running 
 forward to a brow of the cliff , fluttered his hands at his sides like 
 fins or wings of one about to rise in the air , and chanted : 
 
 _ Goodbye , now , goodbye ! <end>   4.559354950584396
<start> <start> Write down all I said 
 And tell Tom , Dick and Harry I rose from the dead . <end>   4.880119640790633
<start> <start> What s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly 
 And Olivet s breezy . . . <end>   4.099027452398428
<start> <start> Goodbye , now , goodbye ! _ 
 
 He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole , fluttering his 
 winglike hands , leaping nimbly , Mercury s hat quivering in the fresh 
 wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries . <end>   3.819725304929771
<start> <start> Haines , who had been laughing guardedly , walked on beside Stephen and 
 said : 
 
 We oughtn t to laugh , I suppose . <end>   6.0821838665202
<start> <start> He s rather blasphemous . <end>   6.421508468012964
<start> <start> I m not a 
 believer myself , that is to say . <end>   6.602600446228724
<start> <start> Still his gaiety takes the harm out of 
 it somehow , doesn t it ? <end>   5.175166631419152
<start> <start> What did he call it ? <end>   6.593771458299128
<start> <start> Joseph the Joiner ? <end>   10.378163146425683
<start> <start> O , Haines said , you have heard it before ? <end>   8.347000010602443
<start> <start> Three times a day , after meals , Stephen said drily . <end>   7.579894454081588
<start> <start> You re not a believer , are you ? <end>   4.933998159906679
<start> <start> Haines asked . <end>   10.973718707475498
<start> <start> I mean , a believer in 
 the narrow sense of the word . <end>   9.279437196615786
<start> <start> There s only one sense of the word , it seems to me , Stephen said . <end>   7.248732910460435
<start> <start> Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a 
 green stone . <end>   5.281931792644978
<start> <start> He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it . <end>   5.15094522920973
<start> <start> Thank you , Stephen said , taking a cigarette . <end>   8.736205695182154
<start> <start> Haines helped himself and snapped the case to . <end>   6.2491570361790565
<start> <start> He put it back in his 
 sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox , sprang 
 it open too , and , having lit his cigarette , held the flaming spunk 
 towards Stephen in the shell of his hands . <end>   5.449159838128602
<start> <start> Yes , of course , he said , as they went on again . <end>   6.55735388697404
<start> <start> Either you believe or 
 you don t , isn t it ? <end>   6.6342721441795405
<start> <start> Personally I couldn t stomach that idea of a 
 personal God . <end>   6.193456694538022
<start> <start> You don t stand for that , I suppose ? <end>   10.658033656572803
<start> <start> He walked on , waiting to be spoken to , trailing his ashplant by his 
 side . <end>   8.354215898463131
<start> <start> Its ferrule followed lightly on the path , squealing at his heels . <end>   5.507489078945762
<start> <start> My familiar , after me , calling , Steeeeeeeeeeeephen ! <end>   7.724285581005866
<start> <start> A wavering line 
 along the path . <end>   6.510486838112657
<start> <start> He wants that key . <end>   6.324816388386008
<start> <start> It is mine . <end>   8.241061424065188
<start> <start> I paid the rent . <end>   6.7454914779265485
<start> <start> Now I eat his salt 
 bread . <end>   3.7219743098763822
<start> <start> Give him the key too . <end>   8.426864699574997
<start> <start> All . <end>   20.818329358944137
<start> <start> He will ask for it . <end>   4.952679650605563
<start> <start> That was in his 
 eyes . <end>   10.305151457994437
<start> <start> After all , Haines began . . . <end>   7.5653278921628475
<start> <start> Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was 
 not all unkind . <end>   5.331034642355077
<start> <start> After all , I should think you are able to free yourself . <end>   7.130806451487859
<start> <start> You are your 
 own master , it seems to me . <end>   6.627446855767885
<start> <start> Italian ? <end>   22.864720483134388
<start> <start> Haines said . <end>   12.479065734114771
<start> <start> A crazy queen , old and jealous . <end>   5.898198686413642
<start> <start> And a third , Stephen said , there is who wants me for odd jobs . <end>   5.1728639765942654
<start> <start> Italian ? <end>   22.864720483134388
<start> <start> Haines said again . <end>   12.692690098781942
<start> <start> What do you mean ? <end>   7.279600453074197
<start> <start> The imperial British state , Stephen answered , his colour rising , and 
 the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church . <end>   5.370351412275526
<start> <start> Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he 
 spoke . <end>   5.487573109480641
<start> <start> I can quite understand that , he said calmly . <end>   6.0920434624932405
<start> <start> An Irishman must think 
 like that , I daresay . <end>   7.9550883115137925
<start> <start> We feel in England that we have treated you 
 rather unfairly . <end>   4.889451219137543
<start> <start> The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen s memory the triumph of 
 their brazen bells : _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam 
 ecclesiam : _ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own 
 rare thoughts , a chemistry of stars . <end>   2.7059354401808524
<start> <start> Symbol of the apostles in the mass 
 for pope Marcellus , the voices blended , singing alone loud in 
 affirmation : and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church 
 militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs . <end>   4.7750792061293055
<start> <start> A horde of heresies 
 fleeing with mitres awry : Photius and the brood of mockers of whom 
 Mulligan was one , and Arius , warring his life long upon the 
 consubstantiality of the Son with the Father , and Valentine , spurning 
 Christ s terrene body , and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who 
 held that the Father was Himself His own Son . <end>   3.7185377607795855
<start> <start> Words Mulligan had spoken 
 a moment since in mockery to the stranger . <end>   6.4313066540466455
<start> <start> Idle mockery . <end>   14.541640879995175
<start> <start> The void 
 awaits surely all them that weave the wind : a menace , a disarming and a 
 worsting from those embattled angels of the church , Michael s host , who 
 defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their 
 shields . <end>   4.342258842153647
<start> <start> Hear , hear ! <end>   7.377262034721269
<start> <start> Prolonged applause . <end>   14.541640879995175
<start> <start> _Zut ! <end>   35.49369557982899
<start> <start> Nom de Dieu ! _ 
 
 Of course I m a Britisher , Haines s voice said , and I feel as one . <end>   8.836983048904015
<start> <start> I 
 don t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either . <end>   4.754329035480368
<start> <start> That s our national problem , I m afraid , just now . <end>   4.876890917289273
<start> <start> Two men stood at the verge of the cliff , watching : businessman , 
 boatman . <end>   6.516126249826504
<start> <start> She s making for Bullock harbour . <end>   4.868644577602296
<start> <start> The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain . <end>   7.484125068221765
<start> <start> There s five fathoms out there , he said . <end>   4.58430601357002
<start> <start> It ll be swept up that way 
 when the tide comes in about one . <end>   5.862674797559127

<start> <start> Here I am . <end>   12.124007131590407
<start> <start> They followed the winding path down to the creek . <end>   6.663089443079062
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan stood 
 on a stone , in shirtsleeves , his unclipped tie rippling over his 
 shoulder . <end>   6.506084886956596
<start> <start> Is the brother with you , Malachi ? <end>   7.15957670382226

<start> <start> Brief exposure . <end>   14.541640879995175
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots . <end>   4.590802574464275
<start> <start> An elderly man shot up near 
 the spur of rock a blowing red face . <end>   3.6974132783648903
<start> <start> He scrambled up by the stones , 
 water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair , water 
 rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black 
 sagging loincloth . <end>   4.899910800892673
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and , glancing at Haines 
 and Stephen , crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and 
 lips and breastbone . <end>   5.186314889454702
<start> <start> Seymour s back in town , the young man said , grasping again his spur of 
 rock . <end>   8.556037029535865

<start> <start> Seymour a bleeding officer ! <end>   5.464914295486849
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan said . <end>   4.311219261582355
<start> <start> He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up , saying 
 tritely : 
 
 Redheaded women buck like goats . <end>   5.404143226566916
<start> <start> He broke off in alarm , feeling his side under his flapping shirt . <end>   4.196772708852316
<start> <start> My twelfth rib is gone , he cried . <end>   6.028131516054937
<start> <start> I m the _Übermensch . _ Toothless 
 Kinch and I , the supermen . <end>   6.6672624404566765
<start> <start> He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his 
 clothes lay . <end>   7.484350911106334
<start> <start> Are you going in here , Malachi ? <end>   6.319527086743842
<start> <start> Yes . <end>   8.022450921693405
<start> <start> Make room in the bed . <end>   10.849093067356197
<start> <start> The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the 
 middle of the creek in two long clean strokes . <end>   5.297493568282931
<start> <start> Haines sat down on a 
 stone , smoking . <end>   11.392164742153183
<start> <start> Are you not coming in ? <end>   6.0651297040568695

<start> <start> Later on , Haines said . <end>   10.434215863759997
<start> <start> Not on my breakfast . <end>   8.428552915990036
<start> <start> Stephen turned away . <end>   9.600037678381831
<start> <start> I m going , Mulligan , he said . <end>   5.500060375863955
<start> <start> Give us that key , Kinch , Buck Mulligan said , to keep my chemise flat . <end>   4.767791827239127
<start> <start> Stephen handed him the key . <end>   9.383356900473986
<start> <start> Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped 
 clothes . <end>   3.74503772601262
<start> <start> And twopence , he said , for a pint . <end>   10.903672761379049

 The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush . <end>   4.51814316047533
<start> <start> He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries 
 echoed dismay . <end>   3.323269929022822
<start> <start> A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called : 
 
 Hockey ! <end>   9.027180208729487
<start> <start> They broke asunder , sidling out of their benches , leaping them . <end>   4.136733650652626

<start> <start> On his 
 cheek , dull and bloodless , a soft stain of ink lay , dateshaped , recent

<start> <start> No , sir . <end>   5.514237092442151
<start> <start> Ugly and futile : lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink , a 
 snail s bed . <end>   4.137287673234621
<start> <start> Yet someone had loved him , borne him in her arms and in 
 her heart . <end>   9.054829206005033
<start> <start> But for her the race of the world would have trampled him 
 underfoot , a squashed boneless snail . <end>   8.054444804607177
<start> <start> She had loved his weak watery 
 blood drained from her own . <end>   3.288294565391614
<start> <start> Was that then real ? <end>   6.834782324285461

<start> <start> His mother s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal 
 bestrode . <end>   2.387987745789878

 the fire , an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes . <end>   5.870364435697685
<start> <start> She had saved him from 
 being trampled underfoot and had gone , scarcely having been . <end>   4.882515078172749
<start> <start> A poor 
 soul gone to heaven : and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox , red 
 reek of rapine in his fur , with merciless bright eyes scraped in the 
 earth , listened , scraped up the earth , listened , scraped and scraped . <end>   3.710091956632717

<start> <start> Gone too from

 narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones . <end>   3.197269246567305

 spoken and the paper under debate was an essay ( new for those days ) , 
 advocating the revival of the Irish tongue . <end>   4.846184487946963
<start> <start> He turned towards Myles Crawford and said : 
 
 You know Gerald Fitzgibbon . <end>   4.7004164061025016

 discourse . <end>   6.600120345368508

<start> <start> Well ? <end>   15.691733836444966
<start> <start> It was the speech , mark you , the professor said , of a finished orator , 
 full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will 
 not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man s contumely 
 upon the new movement . <end>   4.707128337447134

 outspanned hand to his spectacles and , with trembling thumb and 
 ringfinger touching lightly the black rims , steadied them to a new 
 focus . <end>   4.827191890596972

 prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one

 beard round it . <end>   2.9544526734069705

 looked ( though he was not ) a dying man . <end>   4.075910563817492

 unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head , soiled by his 
 withering hair . <end>   3.6613470334513463

 When Fitzgibbon s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply . <end>   3.3363223629318464
<start> <start> Briefly , as well as I can bring them to mind , his words were these . <end>   8.906182404059608

 _ Mr Chairman , ladies and gentlemen : Great was my admiration in 
 listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment 
 since by my learned friend . <end>   4.252892196307575
<start> <start> It seemed to me that I had been transported 
 into a country far away from this country , into an age remote from this 
 age , that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the 
 speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful 
 Moses . _ 
 
 His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear , their smokes 
 ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech . <end>   5.035985432194424
<start> <start> _And let our 
 crooked smokes . _ Noble words coming . <end>   4.917525244218097

<start> <start> Could you try your hand 
 at it yourself ? <end>   7.5257310918967795
<start> <start> _ And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian 
 highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride . <end>   5.338829675513747
<start> <start> I heard 
 his words and their meaning was revealed to me . _ 
 
 FROM THE FATHERS 
 
 
 It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are 
 corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they 
 were good could be corrupted . <end>   4.3419567947593585

<start> <start> Vagrants and daylabourers are you called : the world trembles at 
 our name . _ 
 
 A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech . <end>   5.118656987355884
<start> <start> He lifted his voice above it 
 boldly : 
 
 _ But , ladies and gentlemen , had the youthful Moses listened to and 
 accepted that view of life , had he bowed his head and bowed his will 
 and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never 
 have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage , nor 
 followed the pillar of the cloud by day . <end>   4.770893039298672
<start> <start> He would never have spoken 
 with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai s mountaintop nor ever have 
 come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and 
 bearing in his arms the tables of the law , graven in the language of 
 the outlaw . _ 
 
 He ceased and looked at them , enjoying a silence . <end>   5.149583045610823
<start> <start> OMINOUS FOR HIM ! <end>   8.513158751427794

<start> <start> Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a 
 turfbarge , a towhorse with pendent head , a bargeman with a hat of dirty 
 straw seated amidships , smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above 
 him . <end>   3.9789789970410676
<start> <start> It was idyllic : and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of 
 the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out 
 and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor 
 people . <end>   5.194649632579057

 tram . <end>   3.815946820405553
<start> <start> Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C . C . of 
 saint Agatha s church , north William street , on to Newcomen bridge . <end>   4.614719707128205
<start> <start> At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for 
 he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island . <end>   3.4625809662994396
<start> <start> Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar , a blue ticket tucked with 
 care in the eye of one plump kid glove , while four shillings , a 
 sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into 
 his purse . <end>   5.398006858530704
<start> <start> Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket 
 inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away 
 the ticket . <end>   3.275368576033355
<start> <start> The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father 
 Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap . <end>   5.677625408052332
<start> <start> Father Conmee liked 
 cheerful decorum . <end>   4.589423181110129

 Conmee had finished explaining and looked down . <end>   3.7807937155024014

 supposed . <end>   7.744331778550857
<start> <start> A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman 
 with the glasses . <end>   8.06772726436185
<start> <start> She raised her small gloved fist , yawned ever so 
 gently , tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and 
 smiled tinily , sweetly . <end>   3.2188692823275913
<start> <start> Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car . <end>   8.111465328782511
<start> <start> He perceived also that 
 the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the 
 seat . <end>   9.166048715522004
<start> <start> Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the 
 mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head . <end>   7.553916891863019
<start> <start> At Annesley bridge the tram halted and , when it was about to go , an old 
 woman rose suddenly from her place to alight . <end>   5.808364934471155
<start> <start> The conductor pulled the 
 bellstrap to stay the car for her . <end>   5.619611298535756
<start> <start> She passed out with her basket and a 
 marketnet : and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and 
 basket down : and Father Conmee thought that , as she had nearly passed 
 the end of the penny fare , she was one of those good souls who had 
 always to be told twice _bless you , my child , _ that they have been 
 absolved , _pray for me . _ But they had so many worries in life , so many 
 cares , poor creatures . <end>   6.50579960116124
<start> <start> From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at 
 Father Conmee . <end>   3.8041018783319327
<start> <start> Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men 
 and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S . J . and the African mission 
 and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and 
 brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when 
 their last hour came like a thief in the night . <end>   6.317741867542299
<start> <start> That book by the 
 Belgian jesuit , _Le Nombre des Élus , _ seemed to Father Conmee a 
 reasonable plea . <end>   4.45397532576116
<start> <start> Those were millions of human souls created by God in 
 His Own likeness to whom the faith had not ( D . V . ) been brought . <end>   4.804022871464274
<start> <start> But 
 they were God s souls , created by God . <end>   5.580978019280778
<start> <start> It seemed to Father Conmee a 
 pity that they should all be lost , a waste , if one might say . <end>   5.5156471717853
<start> <start> At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted , was saluted by the 
 conductor and saluted in his turn . <end>   5.253680329580827
<start> <start> It pleased Father Conmee , road and name . <end>   4.373278615795804

 immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining . <end>   4.201479891324161
<start> <start> Then came the call to arms and she was maid , wife and widow in one day . <end>   5.308896932238293
<start> <start> Those were old worldish days , loyal times in joyous townlands , old 
 times in the barony . <end>   4.280688355972658
<start> <start> Father Conmee , walking , thought of his little book _Old Times in the 
 Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and 
 of Mary Rochfort , daughter of lord Molesworth , first countess of 
 Belvedere . <end>   5.516265694438321
<start> <start> A listless lady , no more young , walked alone the shore of lough Ennel , 
 Mary , first countess of Belvedere , listlessly walking in the evening , 
 not startled when an otter plunged . <end>   4.314688605005168
<start> <start> Who could know the truth ? <end>   7.288255735264558

 adultery fully , _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris , _ with 
 her husband s brother ? <end>   3.5217774140476408
<start> <start> She would half confess if she had not all sinned 
 as women did . <end>   4.296934733492338

 smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom , ceiled with full fruit 
 clusters . <end>   2.951215560418133

 were impalmed by Don John Conmee . <end>   5.338178080246507
<start> <start> It was a charming day . <end>   6.451954229622484

 Dollard s figure . <end>   3.0710499451153743

 muttered sneeringly : 
 
 That s a pretty garment , isn t it , for a summer s day ? <end>   6.7141583615965885
<start> <start> Why , God eternally curse your soul , Ben Dollard growled furiously , I

 from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff , saying : 
 
 They were made for a man in his health , Ben , anyhow . <end>   6.638193435869364

 glassyeyed , strode past the Kildare street club . <end>   3.3609607316413945
<start> <start> Ben Dollard frowned and , making suddenly a chanter s mouth , gave forth 
 a deep note . <end>   4.649792933008745
<start> <start> Aw ! <end>   35.49369557982899

 his joyful fingers in the air . <end>   5.397051549779908
<start> <start> Come along with me to the subsheriff s office , he said . <end>   6.494331432914915

<start> <start> For a few days tell him , Father Cowley said anxiously . <end>   7.216459550590903
<start> <start> Ben Dollard halted and stared , his loud orifice open , a dangling button 
 of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the 
 heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright . <end>   4.634361956402708
<start> <start> What few days ? <end>   9.170752233837801

 writ where Jacko put the nuts . <end>   6.361255417680661
<start> <start> He led Father Cowley boldly forward , linked to his bulk . <end>   6.212060416131338
<start> <start> Filberts I believe they were , Mr Dedalus said , as he dropped his

 towards Lord Edward street . <end>   5.4698420907207375

<start> <start> There sleep the mighty dead as 
 in life they slept , warriors and princes of high renown . <end>   3.9681856834303075
<start> <start> A pleasant 
 land it is in sooth of murmuring waters , fishful streams where sport 
 the gurnard , the plaice , the roach , the halibut , the gibbed haddock , 
 the grilse , the dab , the brill , the flounder , the pollock , the mixed 
 coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too 
 numerous to be enumerated . <end>   5.888739442831807
<start> <start> In the mild breezes of the west and of the 
 east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass 
 foliage , the wafty sycamore , the Lebanonian cedar , the exalted 
 planetree , the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal 
 world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied . <end>   4.055378588688958
<start> <start> Lovely 
 maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing 
 the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects 
 as for example golden ingots , silvery fishes , crans of herrings , drafts 
 of eels , codlings , creels of fingerlings , purple seagems and playful 
 insects . <end>   2.7839616069494886

 Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle , princes , the 
 sons of kings . <end>   4.70032574068089

 descended from chieftains . <end>   2.8906398064809857

 foison of the fields , flaskets of cauliflowers , floats of spinach , 
 pineapple chunks , Rangoon beans , strikes of tomatoes , drums of figs , 
 drills of Swedes , spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale , 
 York and Savoy , and trays of onions , pearls of the earth , and punnets 
 of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and 
 red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples 
 and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries , pulpy and 
 pelurious , and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their

<start> <start> Come out here , Geraghty , you

<start> <start> And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed 
 ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers 
 and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and 
 Cuffe s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the 
 various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus 
 heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime 
 premiated milchcows and beeves : and there is ever heard a trampling , 
 cackling , roaring , lowing , bleating , bellowing , rumbling , grunting , 
 champing , chewing , of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from 
 pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy 
 vales of Thomond , from the M Gillicuddy s reeks the inaccessible and 
 lordly Shannon the unfathomable , and from the gentle declivities of the 
 place of the race of Kiar , their udders distended with superabundance 
 of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer s firkins 
 and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great 
 hundreds , various in size , the agate with this dun . <end>   2.383159715968559
<start> <start> So we turned into Barney Kiernan s and there , sure enough , was the 
 citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that 
 bloody mangy mongrel , Garryowen , and he waiting for what the sky would 
 drop in the way of drink . <end>   6.544778995693542
<start> <start> There he is , says I , in his gloryhole , with his cruiskeen lawn and his

<start> <start> Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that 
 bloody dog . <end>   3.9103764422352834
<start> <start> I m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off 
 a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper 
 about a licence . <end>   6.959164441301259
<start> <start> Stand and deliver , says he . <end>   5.038742427404681

<start> <start> Friends here . <end>   14.564748590154444
<start> <start> Pass , friends , says he . <end>   6.136562904446232
<start> <start> Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he : 
 
 What s your opinion of the times ? <end>   7.343249943245282
<start> <start> Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill . <end>   6.5831120101890495
<start> <start> But , begob , Joe was equal to

<start> <start> I think the markets are on a rise , says he , sliding his hand down his 
 fork . <end>   6.5221466027341775
<start> <start> So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says : 
 
 Foreign wars is the cause of it . <end>   6.441917320069633
<start> <start> Arrah , give over your bloody codding , Joe , says I . I ve a thirst on me

<start> <start> Ditto MacAnaspey , says I . 
 
 Three pints , Terry , says Joe . <end>   4.404076206746007
<start> <start> And how s the old heart , citizen ? <end>   9.294667400963794
<start> <start> says 
 he . <end>   21.40642951343999
<start> <start> Never better , _a chara_ , says he . <end>   4.327680815766157
<start> <start> What Garry ? <end>   13.419882132665874
<start> <start> Are we going to win ? <end>   7.251502324327377
<start> <start> Eh ? <end>   11.87231941293771
<start> <start> And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck 
 and , by Jesus , he near throttled him . <end>   10.63441489768293
<start> <start> The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was 
 that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired 
 freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded 
 deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed 
 hero . <end>   3.296462196425709
<start> <start> From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his 
 rocklike mountainous knees were covered , as was likewise the rest of 
 his body wherever visible , with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair 
 in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse ( _Ulex Europeus_ ) . <end>   3.6163986204783636
<start> <start> The widewinged nostrils , from which bristles of the same tawny hue 
 projected , were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous 
 obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest . <end>   2.987420752316088
<start> <start> The eyes in 
 which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the 
 dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower . <end>   7.318888336041703
<start> <start> A powerful current of warm 
 breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his 
 mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations 
 of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground , the 
 summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to 
 vibrate and tremble . <end>   4.184384470339472
<start> <start> He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to 
 the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a 
 girdle of plaited straw and rushes . <end>   3.345984829723685
<start> <start> Beneath this he wore trews of 
 deerskin , roughly stitched with gut . <end>   3.7271978957821914
<start> <start> His nether extremities were 
 encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple , the feet 
 being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of 
 the same beast . <end>   3.9701159818974774
<start> <start> From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled 
 at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with 
 rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and

 poor little Paddy Dignam . <end>   6.89474067788009

<start> <start> Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round

<start> <start> Come in , come on , he won t eat you , says the citizen . <end>   7.912235385595712

<start> <start> Here , says he , take them 
 to hell out of my sight , Alf . <end>   10.20585513832087
<start> <start> Hello , Bloom , says he , what will you 
 have ? <end>   11.444413329316985
<start> <start> So they started arguing about the point , Bloom saying he wouldn t and 
 he couldn t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said 
 well he d just take a cigar . <end>   6.07747895726616
<start> <start> Gob , he s a prudent member and no mistake . <end>   5.454225343520683
<start> <start> Give us one of your prime stinkers , Terry , says Joe . <end>   4.1194734611529285
<start> <start> And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with 
 a black border round it . <end>   5.171312467437262
<start> <start> They re all barbers , says he , from the black country that would hang 
 their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses . <end>   4.664512188900833
<start> <start> And he was telling us there s two fellows waiting below to pull his 
 heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they 
 chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull . <end>   3.7202147242859236

 wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so 
 saith the Lord . <end>   2.369893339789133
<start> <start> So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom 
 comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the 
 business and the old dog smelling him all the time I m told those 
 jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about 
 I don t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on . <end>   5.303542347339592
<start> <start> There s one thing it hasn t a deterrent effect on , says Alf . <end>   4.760739091418813
<start> <start> What s that ? <end>   4.727528267623174
<start> <start> says Joe . <end>   5.362066692607006
<start> <start> The poor bugger s tool that s being hanged , says Alf . <end>   3.84483095901977

<start> <start> God s truth , says Alf . <end>   7.538066000639338
<start> <start> He told me when 
 they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like 
 a poker . <end>   10.363004366600448
<start> <start> Ruling passion strong in death , says Joe , as someone said . <end>   7.215601657195654
<start> <start> That can be explained by science , says Bloom . <end>   5.994104204802229
<start> <start> It s only a natural 
 phenomenon , don t you see , because on account of the . . . <end>   4.870923857878596
<start> <start> And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science 
 and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon . <end>   6.030435786352034
<start> <start> The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered 
 medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the 
 cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would , 
 according to the best approved tradition of medical science , be 
 calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent 
 ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus , 
 thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly 
 dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood 
 to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ 
 resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a 
 morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo 
 mortis per diminutionem capitis . _ 
 
 So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and 
 he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard 
 and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe 
 with him about all the fellows that were hanged , drawn and transported 
 for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this , 
 that and the other . <end>   4.398522001908068
<start> <start> Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a 
 new dog so he ought . <end>   6.454458425049179
<start> <start> Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all 
 round the place and scratching his scabs . <end>   3.522864061732339
<start> <start> And round he goes to Bob 
 Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could 
 get . <end>   5.098361997953844
<start> <start> Give the paw , doggy ! <end>   4.521227559994821

<start> <start> Arrah , bloody end to the paw he d paw and Alf trying to keep him from 
 tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking 
 all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and 
 intelligent dog : give you the bloody pip . <end>   4.755178339383669
<start> <start> Then he starts scraping a few 
 bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs tin he told Terry to 
 bring . <end>   5.5963233518115425
<start> <start> Gob , he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging 
 out of him a yard long for more . <end>   6.048354256812136
<start> <start> Near ate the tin and all , hungry 
 bloody mongrel . <end>   4.41432178717406

 brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet 
 and die for your country , the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and 
 she s far from the land . <end>   4.542235332462627
<start> <start> And Bloom , of course , with his knockmedown 
 cigar putting on swank with his lardy face . <end>   5.45094434813239
<start> <start> Phenomenon ! <end>   24.923299263638793
<start> <start> The fat heap he 
 married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley . <end>   8.646212593892349
<start> <start> Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me 
 there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and 
 Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing 
 bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating 
 meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and 
 taking the lout out for a walk . <end>   6.372621061029175
<start> <start> And one time he led him the rounds of 
 Dublin and , by the holy farmer , he never cried crack till he brought 
 him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him 
 the evils of alcohol and by herrings , if the three women didn t near 
 roast him , it s a queer story , the old one , Bloom s wife and Mrs O Dowd 
 that kept the hotel . <end>   7.003923685654996
<start> <start> Jesus , I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them 
 off chewing the fat . <end>   5.502629105535824
<start> <start> And Bloom with his _but don t you see ? _ and _but 
 on the other hand_ . <end>   6.813596338727786
<start> <start> And sure , more be token , the lout I m told was in 
 Power s after , the blender s , round in Cope street going home footless 
 in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the 
 samples in the bloody establishment . <end>   6.242494446884666
<start> <start> Phenomenon ! <end>   24.923299263638793
<start> <start> The memory of the dead , says the citizen taking up his pintglass and 
 glaring at Bloom . <end>   7.669364922988229
<start> <start> Ay , ay , says Joe . <end>   4.469959814408002

 gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums 
 punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance . <end>   3.625314623015174

 claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the 
 ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its 
 supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle . <end>   3.0260783152143413

 Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person

 senses . <end>   4.572695940111985

 their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates 
 cheered vociferously in a medley of cries , _hoch , banzai , eljen , zivio , 
 chinchin , polla kronia , hiphip , vive , Allah_ , amid which the ringing 
 _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song ( a high double F recalling

 beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers ) was easily distinguishable . <end>   2.8349554771535765

 duodenum , colon , blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully

 onions , done to a nicety , delicious hot breakfast rolls and 
 invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for 
 the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital 
 spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the 
 proceedings from beginning to end but he , with an abnegation rare in 
 these our times , rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying 
 wish ( immediately acceded to ) that the meal should be divided in 
 aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers

 their hands for the last time . <end>   4.932958699784176
<start> <start> A fresh torrent of tears burst from 
 their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people , touched to the 
 inmost core , broke into heartrending sobs , not the least affected being 
 the aged prebendary himself . <end>   4.092993273652102
<start> <start> Big strong men , officers of the peace and 
 genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary , were making frank use of 
 their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye 
 in that record assemblage . <end>   5.716505521836058
<start> <start> A most romantic incident occurred when a 
 handsome young Oxford graduate , noted for his chivalry towards the fair 
 sex , stepped forward and , presenting his visiting card , bankbook and 
 genealogical tree , solicited the hand of the hapless young lady , 
 requesting her to name the day , and was accepted on the spot . <end>   4.272312667820563
<start> <start> Every 
 lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the 
 occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch , a timely and 
 generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion : and when the 
 gallant young Oxonian ( the bearer , by the way , of one of the most 
 timehonoured names in Albion s history ) placed on the finger of his 
 blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in 
 the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds . <end>   4.2512426673917885
<start> <start> Nay , 
 even the stern provostmarshal , lieutenantcolonel Tomkin - Maxwell 
 ffrenchmullan Tomlinson , who presided on the sad occasion , he who had 
 blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without 
 flinching , could not now restrain his natural emotion . <end>   4.063056622652849
<start> <start> With his mailed 
 gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard , by those 
 privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage , _ to 
 murmur to himself in a faltering undertone : 
 
 God blimey if she aint a clinker , that there bleeding tart . <end>   4.3155176199354415
<start> <start> So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the 
 corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can t speak 
 their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a 
 quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he 
 cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the 
 antitreating league and drink , the curse of Ireland . <end>   5.601133138072559

 about the size of it . <end>   8.686993400233487

 his throat till the Lord would call him before you d ever see the froth 
 of his pint . <end>   6.341565051537618
<start> <start> And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their 
 musical evenings , song and dance about she could get up on a truss of 
 hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly 
 blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen 
 bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and 
 oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns , gob , flahoolagh 
 entertainment , don t be talking . <end>   3.9617152699155533
<start> <start> Ireland sober is Ireland free . <end>   4.269882762032666
<start> <start> And 
 then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers 
 shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of . <end>   4.195963810236091
<start> <start> And one or two 
 sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the 
 females , hitting below the belt . <end>   3.6550595450019374
<start> <start> I d train him by kindness , so I 
 would , if he was my dog . <end>   9.038234594675323
<start> <start> Give him a rousing fine kick now and again 
 where it wouldn t blind him . <end>   4.558257812256066
<start> <start> Afraid he ll bite you ? <end>   6.343344905800483
<start> <start> says the citizen , jeering . <end>   5.940354965678088
<start> <start> No , says I . But he might take my leg for a lamppost . <end>   7.4745774045703
<start> <start> So he calls the old dog over . <end>   7.106717657221627
<start> <start> What s on you , Garry ? <end>   8.51120946515733
<start> <start> says he . <end>   10.056640634482703
<start> <start> Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the 
 old towser growling , letting on to answer , like a duet in the opera . <end>   5.7592538435957685
<start> <start> Such growling you never heard as they let off between them . <end>   4.599632765555439
<start> <start> Someone 
 that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono 
 publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of 
 that . <end>   5.9639826892201855
<start> <start> Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth 
 is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws . <end>   8.307917175999888
<start> <start> All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the 
 lower animals ( and their name is legion ) should make a point of not 
 missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the 
 famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ 
 of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends 
 and acquaintances Owen Garry . <end>   3.6819356884438927
<start> <start> The exhibition , which is the result of 
 years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary 
 system , comprises , among other achievements , the recitation of verse . <end>   4.168925904527444
<start> <start> Our greatest living phonetic expert ( wild horses shall not drag it from 
 us ! ) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and 
 compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ 
 resemblance ( the italics are ours ) to the ranns of ancient Celtic 
 bards . <end>   2.656556640593315
<start> <start> We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with 
 which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym 
 of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but 
 rather ( as a contributor D . O . C . points out in an interesting 
 communication published by an evening contemporary ) of the harsher and 
 more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the 
 famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more 
 modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye . <end>   4.737436298825605
<start> <start> We subjoin a 
 specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar 
 whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we 
 believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more 
 than an indication . <end>   3.372752957065107
<start> <start> Perhaps it should be added 
 that the effect is greatly increased if Owen s verse be spoken somewhat 
 slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour . <end>   2.73175640275103

 hear him lapping it up a mile off . <end>   6.552107660158699

<start> <start> Thank you , no , says Bloom . <end>   9.853264145114947
<start> <start> As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet 
 Martin Cunningham , don t you see , about this insurance of poor 
 Dignam s . <end>   3.927866064344558
<start> <start> Martin asked me to go to the house . <end>   11.359478524219597
<start> <start> You see , he , Dignam , I 
 mean , didn t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the 
 time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can t recover on the 
 policy . <end>   8.149127620530884

<start> <start> The wife s advisers , I mean , says Bloom . <end>   5.0294005634217385
<start> <start> Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act 
 like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit 
 of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that 
 Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow 
 contested the mortgagee s right till he near had the head of me addled 
 with his mortgagor under the act . <end>   5.646181663619365

 was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and 
 to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was 
 never a truer , a finer than poor little Willy that s dead to tell her . <end>   5.171771541031036

 request of you this favour . <end>   5.335856212350123

 this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness

<start> <start> The goodness of your heart , 
 I feel sure , will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the 
 expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose 
 poignancy , were I to give vent to my feelings , would deprive me even of 
 speech . <end>   4.524453821591678

 smugging . <end>   5.843339682968617

 Barebones , tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the 
 cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire , 
 stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an 
 illuminated bible , the volume of the word of God and the secret of 
 England s greatness , graciously presented to him by the white chief 
 woman , the great squaw Victoria , with a personal dedication from the 
 august hand of the Royal Donor . <end>   4.957326989340394

 his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak , surnamed Forty 
 Warts , after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and 
 signed his mark in the visitors book , subsequently executing a 
 charming old Abeakutic wardance , in the course of which he swallowed

<start> <start> Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of 
 children , so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could 
 never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that 
 held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown 
 bread with golden syrup on . <end>   4.556270018665293
<start> <start> What a persuasive power that girl had ! <end>   3.443240385968529
<start> <start> But 
 to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold , a perfect little dote in 
 his new fancy bib . <end>   5.554083319098949
<start> <start> None of your spoilt beauties , Flora MacFlimsy sort , 
 was Cissy Caffrey . <end>   5.76398316600097
<start> <start> A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life , 
 always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her 
 cherryripe red lips , a girl lovable in the extreme . <end>   6.469810608424957
<start> <start> And Edy Boardman 
 laughed too at the quaint language of little brother . <end>   4.998324357437561
<start> <start> But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and 
 Master Jacky . <end>   6.092579670820917
<start> <start> Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to 
 this golden rule . <end>   5.64494855659023
<start> <start> The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand 
 which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go 
 wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like 
 the Martello tower had . <end>   4.587900897980253
<start> <start> But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky 
 was selfwilled too and , true to the maxim that every little Irishman s 
 house is his castle , he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose 
 that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and ( alas to relate ! ) the 
 coveted castle too . <end>   4.451591596228133
<start> <start> Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master 
 Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends . <end>   4.720421754865753
<start> <start> At once ! <end>   12.915513873220457
<start> <start> And you , 
 Jacky , for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand . <end>   7.77226753803576
<start> <start> Wait till I 
 catch you for that . <end>   6.2919494424243885
<start> <start> His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for 
 their big sister s word was law with the twins . <end>   3.4892333312536707
<start> <start> And in a sad plight he 
 was too after his misadventure . <end>   7.902580789235923
<start> <start> His little man - o - war top and 
 unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the 
 art of smoothing over life s tiny troubles and very quickly not one 
 speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit . <end>   3.7004321604730372
<start> <start> Still the blue 
 eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed 
 away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and 
 said if she was near him she wouldn t be far from him , her eyes dancing 
 in admonition . <end>   4.7284933772086415
<start> <start> she cried . <end>   9.359469625466227
<start> <start> She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly : 
 
 What s your name ? <end>   4.977927722774593
<start> <start> Butter and cream ? <end>   9.77905145359372
<start> <start> Tell us who is your sweetheart , spoke Edy Boardman . <end>   5.672626079967275
<start> <start> Is Cissy your 
 sweetheart ? <end>   7.687764404075483
<start> <start> Nao , tearful Tommy said . <end>   4.569015034755012
<start> <start> Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart ? <end>   7.635089353968642
<start> <start> Cissy queried . <end>   13.172998318507249
<start> <start> Nao , Tommy said . <end>   5.384017422957486
<start> <start> I know , Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from 
 her shortsighted eyes . <end>   3.7106338574893463
<start> <start> I know who is Tommy s sweetheart . <end>   5.830288515780843
<start> <start> Gerty is 
 Tommy s sweetheart . <end>   7.007918606350051
<start> <start> Nao , Tommy said on the verge of tears . <end>   6.321845069842711
<start> <start> Cissy s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy 
 Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman 
 couldn t see and to mind he didn t wet his new tan shoes . <end>   4.2983937620767705
<start> <start> But who was Gerty ? <end>   13.316956728846655
<start> <start> Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions , lost in thought , 
 gazing far away into the distance was , in very truth , as fair a 
 specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see . <end>   5.095033837755697
<start> <start> She was 
 pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though , as folks often said , 
 she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell . <end>   5.148051030749223
<start> <start> Her figure was slight and 
 graceful , inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had 
 been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the 
 Widow Welch s female pills and she was much better of those discharges 
 she used to get and that tired feeling . <end>   3.626540045997574
<start> <start> The waxen pallor of her face 
 was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth 
 was a genuine Cupid s bow , Greekly perfect . <end>   3.532808363210704
<start> <start> Her hands were of finely 
 veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and 
 queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used 
 to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either . <end>   3.5805385772016214
<start> <start> Bertha Supple 
 told that once to Edy Boardman , a deliberate lie , when she was black 
 out at daggers drawn with Gerty ( the girl chums had of course their 
 little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals ) and she told 
 her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or 
 she d never speak to her again . <end>   6.0701855654632135
<start> <start> No . Honour where honour is due . <end>   3.2578771037859093
<start> <start> There 
 was an innate refinement , a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which 
 was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep . <end>   4.04111907259189
<start> <start> Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in 
 her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education 
 Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the 
 land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow 
 and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their 
 devoirs to her . <end>   3.7477643820907964
<start> <start> Mayhap it was this , the love that might have been , that 
 lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look , tense with suppressed 
 meaning , that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful 
 eyes , a charm few could resist . <end>   5.326755605927436
<start> <start> Why have women such eyes of witchery ? <end>   4.089185394175368
<start> <start> Gerty s were of the bluest Irish blue , set off by lustrous lashes and 
 dark expressive brows . <end>   5.1359261981048085
<start> <start> Time was when those brows were not so silkily 
 seductive . <end>   3.500383211729344
<start> <start> It was Madame Vera Verity , directress of the Woman Beautiful 
 page of the Princess Novelette , who had first advised her to try 
 eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes , so 
 becoming in leaders of fashion , and she had never regretted it . <end>   4.126210694350345
<start> <start> Then 
 there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase 
 your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose ? <end>   4.572080239700605
<start> <start> That would 
 suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one . <end>   6.910164161413097
<start> <start> But Gerty s crowning 
 glory was her wealth of wonderful hair . <end>   2.9509776885990857
<start> <start> It was dark brown with a 
 natural wave in it . <end>   5.35481913093356
<start> <start> She had cut it that very morning on account of the 
 new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of 
 luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too , Thursday for wealth . <end>   4.163085272037923
<start> <start> And 
 just now at Edy s words as a telltale flush , delicate as the faintest 
 rosebloom , crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet 
 girlish shyness that of a surety God s fair land of Ireland did not 
 hold her equal . <end>   3.7560836782015294
<start> <start> For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes . <end>   5.1703107031442075
<start> <start> She was 
 about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue . <end>   6.323161571482061
<start> <start> Inclination prompted her to speak out : dignity told her to be silent . <end>   6.903610218311217
<start> <start> The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out 
 into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young 
 May morning . <end>   5.1882932965944795
<start> <start> She knew right well , no - one better , what made squinty Edy 
 say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a 
 lovers quarrel . <end>   6.089100001162644
<start> <start> As per usual somebody s nose was out of joint about 
 the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding 
 up and down in front of her window . <end>   5.011006985198285
<start> <start> Only now his father kept him in in 
 the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate 
 that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a 
 doctor when he left the high school like his brother W . E . Wylie who 
 was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university . <end>   6.271070060286261
<start> <start> Little 
 recked he perhaps for what she felt , that dull aching void in her heart 
 sometimes , piercing to the core . <end>   4.181688697643365
<start> <start> Yet he was young and perchance he 
 might learn to love her in time . <end>   6.730573841387305
<start> <start> They were protestants in his family 
 and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed 
 Virgin and then Saint Joseph . <end>   5.128288620569808
<start> <start> But he was undeniably handsome with an 
 exquisite nose and he was what he looked , every inch a gentleman , the 
 shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would 
 know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the 
 bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice 
 perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size 
 too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so 
 frightfully clever because he didn t go and ride up and down in front 
 of her bit of a garden . <end>   6.707619394978862
<start> <start> Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of 
 Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be 
 out . <end>   6.383966101376413
<start> <start> A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes ( because 
 it was expected in the _Lady s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be 
 worn ) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket 
 ( in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her 
 favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit ) and a navy 
 threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful 
 figure to perfection . <end>   3.333888986392567
<start> <start> She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of 
 wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue 
 chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone . <end>   3.1966530585478057
<start> <start> All Tuesday 
 week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she 
 found what she wanted at Clery s summer sales , the very it , slightly 
 shopsoiled but you would never notice , seven fingers two and a penny . <end>   3.6556837720905415
<start> <start> She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on 
 then , smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to 
 her ! <end>   7.6694389488631955
<start> <start> And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew 
 that that would take the shine out of some people she knew . <end>   7.003357171534949
<start> <start> Her shoes 
 were the newest thing in footwear ( Edy Boardman prided herself that she 
 was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell , a 
 five , and never would ash , oak or elm ) with patent toecaps and just one 
 smart buckle over her higharched instep . <end>   3.891844515103842
<start> <start> Her wellturned ankle displayed 
 its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount 
 and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with 
 highspliced heels and wide garter tops . <end>   3.596287000847532
<start> <start> As for undies they were Gerty s 
 chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet 
 seventeen ( though Gerty would never see seventeen again ) can find it in 
 his heart to blame her ? <end>   3.6128284598417246
<start> <start> She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty 
 stitchery , three garments and nighties extra , and each set slotted with 
 different coloured ribbons , rosepink , pale blue , mauve and peagreen , 
 and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the 
 wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because 
 she wouldn t trust those washerwomen as far as she d see them scorching 
 the things . <end>   3.5025502151625827
<start> <start> She was wearing the blue for luck , hoping against hope , her 
 own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on 
 her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his 
 father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and 
 because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was 
 dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside 
 out and that was for luck and lovers meeting if you put those things 
 on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so 
 long as it wasn t of a Friday . <end>   5.1033431482597384
<start> <start> And yet and yet ! <end>   7.665379609848891
<start> <start> That strained look on her face ! <end>   7.885183179141774
<start> <start> A gnawing sorrow is 
 there all the time . <end>   5.794388513659965
<start> <start> You are lovely , Gerty , it said . <end>   7.427426131738568
<start> <start> Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain . <end>   4.741344686703598
<start> <start> Yes , she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage 
 has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T . 
 C . D . ( because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs 
 Wylie ) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was 
 wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox 
 was not to be . <end>   4.534105718341702
<start> <start> He was too young to understand . <end>   7.088407269721136
<start> <start> He would not believe in 
 love , a woman s birthright . <end>   10.748052835787538
<start> <start> The night of the party long ago in Stoer s 
 ( he was still in short trousers ) when they were alone and he stole an 
 arm round her waist she went white to the very lips . <end>   6.108526881537756
<start> <start> He called her 
 little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss ( the 
 first ! ) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from 
 the room with a remark about refreshments . <end>   7.10571111414306
<start> <start> Impetuous fellow ! <end>   14.541640879995175
<start> <start> Strength 
 of character had never been Reggy Wylie s strong point and he who would 
 woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men . <end>   4.6547671755297815
<start> <start> But waiting , 
 always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be 
 over . <end>   7.839263554536764
<start> <start> No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous 
 love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who 
 had not found his ideal , perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey , 
 and who would understand , take her in his sheltering arms , strain her 
 to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort 
 her with a long long kiss . <end>   4.337528054792597
<start> <start> It would be like heaven . <end>   7.4547323863883115
<start> <start> For such a one she 
 yearns this balmy summer eve . <end>   4.706105045242
<start> <start> With all the heart of her she longs to be 
 his only , his affianced bride for riches for poor , in sickness in 
 health , till death us two part , from this to this day forward . <end>   5.73598071972972
<start> <start> And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was 
 just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his 
 little wife to be . <end>   5.339394667490879
<start> <start> Then they could talk about her till they went blue 
 in the face , Bertha Supple too , and Edy , little spitfire , because she 
 would be twentytwo in November . <end>   5.602653615201873
<start> <start> She would care for him with creature 
 comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked 
 that feeling of hominess . <end>   3.101427721702951
<start> <start> He would be 
 tall with broad shoulders ( she had always admired tall men for a 
 husband ) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed 
 sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their 
 honeymoon ( three wonderful weeks ! ) and then , when they settled down in 
 a nice snug and cosy little homely house , every morning they would both 
 have brekky , simple but perfectly served , for their own two selves and 
 before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a 
 good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes . <end>   4.336667143722371
<start> <start> Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then 
 she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run 
 off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight . <end>   7.112145835387079
<start> <start> The temper of him ! <end>   12.922449140423566
<start> <start> O , he was a man already was little Tommy 
 Caffrey since he was out of pinnies . <end>   6.667410965430789
<start> <start> Edy told him no , no and to be off 
 now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him . <end>   11.046637151805331
<start> <start> You re not my sister , naughty Tommy said . <end>   3.4985837531349455
<start> <start> But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up , look up high at her 
 finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand 
 and Tommy after it in full career , having won the day . <end>   5.71414161373506
<start> <start> Anything for a quiet life , laughed Ciss . <end>   8.817709208520265
<start> <start> And she tickled tiny tot s two cheeks to make him forget and played 
 here s the lord mayor , here s his two horses , here s his gingerbread 
 carriage and here he walks in , chinchopper , chinchopper , chinchopper 
 chin . <end>   3.066932203460887
<start> <start> But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way 
 like that from everyone always petting him . <end>   3.5814061348610746
<start> <start> I d like to give him something , she said , so I would , where I won t 
 say . <end>   7.490793070372962
<start> <start> On the beeoteetom , laughed Cissy merrily . <end>   3.348594387337005
<start> <start> Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy 
 saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she d be ashamed of her 
 life to say , flushing a deep rosy red , and Edy Boardman said she was 
 sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said . <end>   4.314965729258528
<start> <start> But not a pin cared 
 Ciss . <end>   6.015171191165308
<start> <start> Let him ! <end>   12.763660937316622
<start> <start> she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of 
 her nose . <end>   9.600608641270629
<start> <start> Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I d look at 
 him . <end>   9.459887709097401
<start> <start> Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls . <end>   6.532609946573515
<start> <start> You had to laugh at her sometimes . <end>   7.450123317891107
<start> <start> For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea 
 and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men s faces on 
 her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to 
 go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the 
 Miss White . <end>   4.787626451592114
<start> <start> That was just like Cissycums . <end>   8.345867163703504
<start> <start> O , and will you ever forget 
 her the evening she dressed up in her father s suit and hat and the 
 burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road , smoking a 
 cigarette . <end>   7.289917855225632
<start> <start> There was none to come up to her for fun . <end>   8.177854006670783
<start> <start> But she was 
 sincerity itself , one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever 
 made , not one of your twofaced things , too sweet to be wholesome . <end>   5.849442630918585
<start> <start> And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the 
 pealing anthem of the organ . <end>   8.219090649878373
<start> <start> They were there 
 gathered together without distinction of social class ( and a most 
 edifying spectacle it was to see ) in that simple fane beside the waves , 
 after the storms of this weary world , kneeling before the feet of the 
 immaculate , reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto , beseeching her 
 to intercede for them , the old familiar words , holy Mary , holy virgin 
 of virgins . <end>   4.491431374523086
<start> <start> How sad to poor Gerty s ears ! <end>   4.864675621917928
<start> <start> Had her father only avoided

 the drink habit cured in Pearson s Weekly , she might now be rolling in 
 her carriage , second to none . <end>   4.196700458944183
<start> <start> Over and over had she told herself that 
 as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp 
 because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window 
 dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket , thinking . <end>   5.1294818461273115
<start> <start> But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had 
 cast its shadow over her childhood days . <end>   2.6855583086689947
<start> <start> Nay , she had even witnessed in 
 the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen 
 her own father , a prey to the fumes of intoxication , forget himself 
 completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it 
 was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of 
 kindness , deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low . <end>   6.32082960963357
<start> <start> And Gerty , rapt in thought , scarce saw or heard 
 her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman 
 off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like 
 himself passing along the strand taking a short walk . <end>   3.9503905067566167
<start> <start> You never saw him 
 any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a 
 father because he was too old or something or on account of his face 
 ( it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell ) or his carbuncly nose with the 
 pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose . <end>   6.606839409654796
<start> <start> Poor 
 father ! <end>   12.199945045486333
<start> <start> With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me , 
 Mary , how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they 
 had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby s salad dressing for supper 
 and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died 
 suddenly and was buried , God have mercy on him , from a stroke . <end>   3.5262764939315128
<start> <start> Her 
 mother s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom 
 and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have 
 had a group taken . <end>   5.765519000325952
<start> <start> No - one would have thought the end was so near . <end>   5.563743750817832
<start> <start> Now 
 he was laid to rest . <end>   8.97753204575298
<start> <start> And her mother said to him to let that be a 
 warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn t even go to the 
 funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him 
 the letters and samples from his office about Catesby s cork lino , 
 artistic , standard designs , fit for a palace , gives tiptop wear and 
 always bright and cheery in the home . <end>   5.679864528469028
<start> <start> A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the 
 house , a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in 
 gold . <end>   5.707491323155162
<start> <start> And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was 
 it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn t 
 like her mother s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single 
 thing they ever had words about , taking snuff . <end>   3.5276561125734434
<start> <start> Everyone thought the 
 world of her for her gentle ways . <end>   11.442439049764033
<start> <start> It was Gerty who turned off the gas 
 at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of 
 that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime 
 Mr Tunney the grocer s christmas almanac , the picture of halcyon days 
 where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a 
 threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with 
 oldtime chivalry through her lattice window . <end>   3.9368679070605297
<start> <start> You could see there was a 
 story behind it . <end>   7.901467778207698
<start> <start> She was in a 
 soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in 
 chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat . <end>   7.7138208058223166
<start> <start> She often looked at them 
 dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own 
 arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and 
 thought about those times because she had found out in Walker s 
 pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the 
 halcyon days what they meant . <end>   4.7447439368463495
<start> <start> The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till 
 at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no 
 getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he 
 could down towards the seaweedy rocks . <end>   3.93692271790671
<start> <start> Needless to say poor Tommy was 
 not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was 
 sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted 
 the ball . <end>   4.4755103430217344
<start> <start> Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries 
 and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it 
 to her please . <end>   5.500054269886931
<start> <start> The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then 
 threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the 
 slope and stopped right under Gerty s skirt near the little pool by the 
 rock . <end>   4.890814855523887
<start> <start> The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it 
 away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she 
 wished their stupid ball hadn t come rolling down to her and she gave a 
 kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed . <end>   4.943757191431699
<start> <start> If you fail try again , Edy Boardman said . <end>   4.660300492711892
<start> <start> Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip . <end>   3.082655533688011
<start> <start> A delicate pink crept into her 
 pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted 
 her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball 
 a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it 
 down towards the shingle . <end>   4.805857347298545
<start> <start> Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else 
 to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking . <end>   6.573317471752651
<start> <start> She 
 felt the warm flush , a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell , 
 surging and flaming into her cheeks . <end>   4.458241773733487
<start> <start> Till then they had only exchanged 
 glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she 
 ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the 
 twilight , wan and strangely drawn , seemed to her the saddest she had 
 ever seen . <end>   4.957030460837202
<start> <start> Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted 
 and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain 
 of original sin , spiritual vessel , pray for us , honourable vessel , pray 
 for us , vessel of singular devotion , pray for us , mystical rose . <end>   3.954240672724463
<start> <start> And 
 careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many 
 who had erred and wandered , their eyes wet with contrition but for all 
 that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told 
 them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary , 
 the most pious Virgin s intercessory power that it was not recorded in 
 any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever 
 abandoned by her . <end>   3.898692822972619
<start> <start> The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of 
 childhood are but as fleeting summer showers . <end>   3.1708310014599244
<start> <start> Cissy Caffrey played with 
 baby Boardman till he crowed with glee , clapping baby hands in air . <end>   4.016458338747526
<start> <start> Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was 
 Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah ! <end>   5.953528590155813
<start> <start> and , my 
 word , didn t the little chap enjoy that ! <end>   10.31313488971986
<start> <start> And then she told him to say 
 papa . <end>   8.043367608675524
<start> <start> Say papa , baby . <end>   7.513166128126551
<start> <start> Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa . <end>   3.6346930593726285
<start> <start> And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for 
 eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of 
 health , a perfect little bunch of love , and he would certainly turn out 
 to be something great , they said . <end>   5.7591350244741175
<start> <start> Haja ja ja haja . <end>   5.957658565227533
<start> <start> Of course his infant majesty was most 
 obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it : 
 
 Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa . <end>   3.3054679296207463
<start> <start> And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks . <end>   2.880319555070058
<start> <start> It was all 
 no use soothering him with no , nono , baby , no and telling him about the 
 geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss , always readywitted , gave 
 him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen 
 was quickly appeased . <end>   5.158191763285557
<start> <start> Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out 
 of that and not get on her nerves , no hour to be out , and the little 
 brats of twins . <end>   6.166746533093896
<start> <start> She gazed out towards the distant sea . <end>   6.081623688192968
<start> <start> It was like the 
 paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured 
 chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out , 
 the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and 
 to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they 
 burned in the church like a kind of waft . <end>   7.641244616206052
<start> <start> And while she gazed her heart 
 went pitapat . <end>   4.075105832140411
<start> <start> Yes , it was her he was looking at , and there was meaning 
 in his look . <end>   9.374167524899734
<start> <start> His eyes burned into her as though they would search her 
 through and through , read her very soul . <end>   4.1730311944775496
<start> <start> Wonderful eyes they were , 
 superbly expressive , but could you trust them ? <end>   6.069061570992494
<start> <start> She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face 
 that he was a foreigner , the image of the photo she had of Martin 
 Harvey , the matinee idol , only for the moustache which she preferred 
 because she wasn t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they 
 two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see 
 whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he 
 was sitting . <end>   5.485691640747926
<start> <start> He was in deep mourning , she could see that , and the story 
 of a haunting sorrow was written on his face . <end>   8.432564162289461
<start> <start> She would have given 
 worlds to know what it was . <end>   6.872556956640545
<start> <start> He was looking up so intently , so still , 
 and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel 
 buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the 
 toes down . <end>   5.657499192524673
<start> <start> She was glad that something told her to put on the 
 transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was 
 far away . <end>   5.853718974567717
<start> <start> Here was that of which she had so often dreamed . <end>   10.512892914146098
<start> <start> It was he 
 who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him 
 because she felt instinctively that he was like no - one else . <end>   6.742071519407987
<start> <start> The very 
 heart of the girlwoman went out to him , her dreamhusband , because she 
 knew on the instant it was him . <end>   9.52483971700563
<start> <start> If he had suffered , more sinned against 
 than sinning , or even , even , if he had been himself a sinner , a wicked 
 man , she cared not . <end>   6.331348517182077
<start> <start> Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could 
 convert him easily if he truly loved her . <end>   4.085090862783945
<start> <start> There were wounds that wanted 
 healing with heartbalm . <end>   3.1213504785241413
<start> <start> She was a womanly woman not like other flighty 
 girls unfeminine he had known , those cyclists showing off what they 
 hadn t got and she just yearned to know all , to forgive all if she 
 could make him fall in love with her , make him forget the memory of the 
 past . <end>   4.792736320071611
<start> <start> Then mayhap he would embrace her gently , like a real man , 
 crushing her soft body to him , and love her , his ownest girlie , for 
 herself alone . <end>   6.153397194362542
<start> <start> Refuge of sinners . <end>   8.513158751427794
<start> <start> Comfortress of the afflicted . <end>   24.09562445302712
<start> <start> _Ora pro nobis_ . <end>   7.909869501502436
<start> <start> Well 
 has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy 
 can never be lost or cast away : and fitly is she too a haven of refuge 
 for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her 
 own heart . <end>   3.850350624161936
<start> <start> Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church , the 
 stained glass windows lighted up , the candles , the flowers and the blue 
 banners of the blessed Virgin s sodality and Father Conroy was helping 
 Canon O Hanlon at the altar , carrying things in and out with his eyes 
 cast down . <end>   5.782904205486166
<start> <start> He told her that time 
 when she told him about that in confession , crimsoning up to the roots 
 of her hair for fear he could see , not to be troubled because that was 
 only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature s laws , he 
 said , in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the 
 nature of woman instituted by God , he said , and that Our Blessed Lady 
 herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to 
 Thy Word . <end>   6.428308594861056
<start> <start> He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and 
 thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design 
 for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the 
 mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little 
 house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the 
 forty hours adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a 
 present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or 
 some place . <end>   5.135606611663113
<start> <start> The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky 
 threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it . <end>   4.245080763436559
<start> <start> Little 
 monkeys common as ditchwater . <end>   3.8726469827644534
<start> <start> Someone ought to take them and give them 
 a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places , the both of 
 them . <end>   8.854904747593473
<start> <start> And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they 
 were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned . <end>   5.012990046773776
<start> <start> Jacky ! <end>   31.40138937508791
<start> <start> Tommy ! <end>   30.154654903862255
<start> <start> Not they ! <end>   12.811182057817842
<start> <start> What a great notion they had ! <end>   7.871323263584248
<start> <start> So Cissy said it was the very 
 last time she d ever bring them out . <end>   6.459446252293668
<start> <start> She jumped up and called them and 
 she ran down the slope past him , tossing her hair behind her which had 
 a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the 
 thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn t get it to grow 
 long because it wasn t natural so she could just go and throw her hat 
 at it . <end>   5.607520660766866
<start> <start> She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn t rip 
 up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a 
 lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece 
 whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just 
 because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see 
 all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as 
 possible . <end>   6.063041778439716
<start> <start> It would have served her just right if she had tripped up 
 over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French 
 heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble . <end>   4.326202851955267
<start> <start> _Tableau ! _ 
 That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that 
 to witness . <end>   9.588741224183803
<start> <start> Queen of angels , queen of patriarchs , queen of prophets , of all saints , 
 they prayed , queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy 
 handed the thurible to Canon O Hanlon and he put in the incense and 
 censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and 
 she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she 
 didn t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a 
 bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking 
 that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O Hanlon handed 
 the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the 
 Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she 
 just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to 
 the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_ . <end>   5.018176263565118
<start> <start> Three and eleven she paid for those 
 stockings in Sparrow s of George s street on the Tuesday , no the Monday 
 before Easter and there wasn t a brack on them and that was what he was 
 looking at , transparent , and not at her insignificant ones that had 
 neither shape nor form ( the cheek of her ! ) because he had eyes in his 
 head to see the difference for himself . <end>   5.202833780089305
<start> <start> Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with 
 her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a 
 streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought 
 only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her 
 petticoat hanging like a caricature . <end>   5.942741796941213
<start> <start> Gerty just took off her hat for a 
 moment to settle her hair and a prettier , a daintier head of nutbrown 
 tresses was never seen on a girl s shoulders a radiant little vision , 
 in sooth , almost maddening in its sweetness . <end>   4.430246310944469
<start> <start> You would have to travel 
 many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that . <end>   4.793622501955923
<start> <start> She 
 could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes 
 that set her tingling in every nerve . <end>   4.449692838829301
<start> <start> She put on her hat so that she 
 could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster 
 for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes . <end>   4.310102402795911
<start> <start> He was 
 eying her as a snake eyes its prey . <end>   5.852302957932679
<start> <start> Her woman s instinct told her that 
 she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet 
 swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a 
 glorious rose . <end>   5.182555023213365
<start> <start> Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty , 
 half smiling , with her specs like an old maid , pretending to nurse the 
 baby . <end>   5.792406840752995
<start> <start> Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was 
 why no - one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no 
 concern of hers . <end>   5.764179861120427
<start> <start> And she said to Gerty : 
 
 A penny for your thoughts . <end>   7.195446044223732
<start> <start> What ? <end>   7.275240556106635
<start> <start> replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth . <end>   6.58037609448171
<start> <start> I 
 was only wondering was it late . <end>   7.510737271934616
<start> <start> Because she wished to goodness they d take the snottynosed twins and 
 their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just 
 gave a gentle hint about its being late . <end>   5.025749636772653
<start> <start> And when Cissy came up Edy 
 asked her the time and Miss Cissy , as glib as you like , said it was 
 half past kissing time , time to kiss again . <end>   5.7980902273517785
<start> <start> But Edy wanted to know 
 because they were told to be in early . <end>   9.54736628145806
<start> <start> Wait , said Cissy , I ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what s the 
 time by his conundrum . <end>   6.335263876468117
<start> <start> So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his 
 hand out of his pocket , getting nervous , and beginning to play with his 
 watchchain , looking up at the church . <end>   7.105957156974683
<start> <start> Passionate nature though he was 
 Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself . <end>   6.13856812848125
<start> <start> One moment 
 he had been there , fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze , and 
 the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman , selfcontrol 
 expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure . <end>   5.584308389275029
<start> <start> Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the 
 right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch , listening to 
 it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry 
 his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the 
 sun was set . <end>   5.9337540830864555
<start> <start> His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in 
 measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones . <end>   6.7008657789754045
<start> <start> Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said 
 his waterworks were out of order . <end>   5.998088213099427
<start> <start> Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O Hanlon 
 got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he 
 told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire 
 to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and 
 she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the 
 works and she swung her leg more in and out in time . <end>   5.430376260082604
<start> <start> It was getting 
 darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was 
 winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it 
 back and put his hands back into his pockets . <end>   7.3331513980649445
<start> <start> She felt a kind of a 
 sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp 
 and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on 
 because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of 
 the moon . <end>   7.002792967700298
<start> <start> His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her 
 every contour , literally worshipping at her shrine . <end>   4.366359994140605
<start> <start> If ever there was 
 undisguised admiration in a man s passionate gaze it was there plain to 
 be seen on that man s face . <end>   7.4740372712501015
<start> <start> It is for you , Gertrude MacDowell , and you 
 know it . <end>   8.389536733731
<start> <start> Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty 
 noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect 
 because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place 
 to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins caps and tidied 
 their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O Hanlon 
 stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed 
 him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti 
 eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and 
 asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just 
 answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she 
 heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over . <end>   4.5177004302421775
<start> <start> Gerty winced sharply . <end>   7.586911117645823
<start> <start> A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn 
 immeasurable . <end>   3.2432296953110744
<start> <start> It hurt O yes , it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet 
 way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded 
 little cat she was . <end>   4.638987263644842
<start> <start> Gerty s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but 
 she fought back the sob that rose to her throat , so slim , so flawless , 
 so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of . <end>   3.736285665228697
<start> <start> She had loved him better than he knew . <end>   5.523359934150286
<start> <start> Lighthearted deceiver and fickle 
 like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and 
 for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears . <end>   7.12341302864781
<start> <start> Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she 
 sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them 
 to see . <end>   4.816216042829515
<start> <start> O , responded Gerty , quick as lightning , laughing , and the proud head 
 flashed up . <end>   4.900103926891381
<start> <start> I can throw my cap at who I like because it s leap year . <end>   4.162399828342653
<start> <start> Her words rang out crystalclear , more musical than the cooing of the 
 ringdove , but they cut the silence icily . <end>   4.047390699431575
<start> <start> There was that in her young 
 voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with . <end>   7.805527223828923
<start> <start> As 
 for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck 
 him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as 
 much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a 
 dozen pieces . <end>   5.3310382534019025
<start> <start> And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him 
 one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot . <end>   4.86946095363427
<start> <start> Miss puny little Edy s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty 
 could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a 
 towering rage though she hid it , the little kinnatt , because that shaft 
 had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was 
 something aloof , apart , in another sphere , that she was not of them and 
 never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it 
 so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it . <end>   4.873527216752181
<start> <start> Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked 
 in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because 
 the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior . <end>   5.164526749558686
<start> <start> And Cissy told 
 him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and 
 baby looked just too ducky , laughing up out of his gleeful eyes , and 
 Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby , 
 without as much as by your leave , sent up his compliments to all and 
 sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib . <end>   5.320062227759446
<start> <start> O my ! <end>   12.170104132710122
<start> <start> Puddeny pie ! <end>   14.541640879995175
<start> <start> protested Ciss . <end>   14.541640879995175
<start> <start> He has his bib destroyed . <end>   5.209689711140413
<start> <start> The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set 
 that little matter to rights . <end>   3.1509551863351226
<start> <start> Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy 
 asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was 
 flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed 
 it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction 
 because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet 
 seashore because Canon O Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that 
 Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the 
 Blessed Sacrament in his hands . <end>   4.66535356091666
<start> <start> How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight , the last glimpse 
 of Erin , the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time 
 a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk , hither , 
 thither , with a tiny lost cry . <end>   6.210559202305094
<start> <start> And she could see far away the lights of 
 the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of 
 paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the 
 lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church 
 grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked 
 and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn 
 his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss 
 Cummins , author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales . <end>   3.853357678703535
<start> <start> For Gerty had her 
 dreams that no - one knew of . <end>   4.748470897152421
<start> <start> She loved to read poetry and when she got a 
 keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the 
 coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of 
 her toilettable which , though it did not err on the side of luxury , was 
 scrupulously neat and clean . <end>   4.603295647785893
<start> <start> It was there she kept her girlish treasure 
 trove , the tortoiseshell combs , her child of Mary badge , the whiterose 
 scent , the eyebrowleine , her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to 
 change when her things came home from the wash and there were some 
 beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in 
 Hely s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if 
 she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so 
 deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening 
 round the potherbs . <end>   4.450736156660109
<start> <start> _Art thou real , my ideal ? _ it was called by Louis J 
 Walsh , Magherafelt , and after there was something about _twilight , wilt 
 thou ever ? _ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry , so sad in its transient 
 loveliness , had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the 
 years were slipping by for her , one by one , and but for that one 
 shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an 
 accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it . <end>   3.7104099396729064
<start> <start> But it must end , she felt . <end>   10.18403591042154
<start> <start> If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there 
 would be no holding back for her . <end>   5.38857975384079
<start> <start> Love laughs at locksmiths . <end>   5.502537239493753
<start> <start> She would 
 make the great sacrifice . <end>   7.818232039519265
<start> <start> Her every effort would be to share his 
 thoughts . <end>   7.496614995526044
<start> <start> Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his 
 days with happiness . <end>   6.8699766523175585
<start> <start> There was the allimportant question and she was 
 dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife 
 or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land 
 of song had to have her put into a madhouse , cruel only to be kind . <end>   6.026172083582644
<start> <start> But 
 even if what then ? <end>   4.982317333926914
<start> <start> Would it make a very great difference ? <end>   6.121403791996693
<start> <start> From 
 everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively 
 recoiled . <end>   3.798499590155475
<start> <start> She loathed that sort of person , the fallen women off the 
 accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and 
 coarse men with no respect for a girl s honour , degrading the sex and 
 being taken up to the police station . <end>   5.552025667122914
<start> <start> No , no : not that . <end>   6.296915587463778
<start> <start> They would be 
 just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other 
 in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess . <end>   6.717379424717963
<start> <start> Perhaps it was 
 an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall . <end>   8.34886983876708
<start> <start> She 
 thought she understood . <end>   6.74758594225416
<start> <start> She would try to understand him because men 
 were so different . <end>   5.852930751494395
<start> <start> The old love was waiting , waiting with little white 
 hands stretched out , with blue appealing eyes . <end>   4.608513729682588
<start> <start> Heart of mine ! <end>   13.396000044141033
<start> <start> She would 
 follow , her dream of love , the dictates of her heart that told her he 
 was her all in all , the only man in all the world for her for love was 
 the master guide . <end>   10.100715051586523
<start> <start> Nothing else mattered . <end>   7.348138348037429
<start> <start> Come what might she would be 
 wild , untrammelled , free . <end>   5.189958672665699
<start> <start> Canon O Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and 
 genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then 
 he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and 
 Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked 
 wasn t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out : 
 
 O , look , Cissy ! <end>   4.452984159556878
<start> <start> And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over 
 the trees beside the church , blue and then green and purple . <end>   5.055404913173071
<start> <start> It s fireworks , Cissy Caffrey said . <end>   4.281653917856306
<start> <start> Come on , Gerty , Cissy called . <end>   5.394614835466267
<start> <start> It s the bazaar fireworks . <end>   6.684822762119557
<start> <start> But Gerty was adamant . <end>   6.347381702124566
<start> <start> She had no intention of being at their beck and 
 call . <end>   6.154196729668854
<start> <start> If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she 
 could see from where she was . <end>   5.319524681338763
<start> <start> The eyes that were fastened upon her set 
 her pulses tingling . <end>   4.418309859757354
<start> <start> She looked at him a moment , meeting his glance , 
 and a light broke in upon her . <end>   7.06540446782158
<start> <start> Whitehot passion was in that face , 
 passion silent as the grave , and it had made her his . <end>   10.453543970366875
<start> <start> At last they were 
 left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he 
 could be trusted to the death , steadfast , a sterling man , a man of 
 inflexible honour to his fingertips . <end>   6.206402478607463
<start> <start> She leaned back far to look up where the 
 fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall 
 back looking up and there was no - one to see only him and her when she 
 revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that , supply 
 soft and delicately rounded , and she seemed to hear the panting of his 
 heart , his hoarse breathing , because she knew too about the passion of 
 men like that , hotblooded , because Bertha Supple told her once in dead 
 secret and made her swear she d never about the gentleman lodger that 
 was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had 
 pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and 
 she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine 
 sometimes in the bed . <end>   5.2330397081240525
<start> <start> But this was altogether different from a thing 
 like that because there was all the difference because she could almost 
 feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his 
 handsome lips . <end>   7.1091039107274865
<start> <start> Besides there was absolution so long as you didn t do 
 the other thing before being married and there ought to be women 
 priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy 
 Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes 
 so that she too , my dear , and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors 
 photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on 
 the way it did . <end>   5.260579683503539
<start> <start> And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look , there was another and she leaned 
 back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent 
 and they all saw it and they all shouted to look , look , there it was 
 and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something 
 queer was flying through the air , a soft thing , to and fro , dark . <end>   5.778590198691998
<start> <start> And 
 she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees , up , up , and , in 
 the tense hush , they were all breathless with excitement as it went 
 higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up 
 after it , high , high , almost out of sight , and her face was suffused 
 with a divine , an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see 
 her other things too , nainsook knickers , the fabric that caresses the 
 skin , better than those other pettiwidth , the green , four and eleven , 
 on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and 
 then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was 
 trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full 
 view high up above her knee where no - one ever not even on the swing or 
 wading and she wasn t ashamed and he wasn t either to look in that 
 immodest way like that because he couldn t resist the sight of the 
 wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so 
 immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking , looking . <end>   5.296301498638915
<start> <start> She 
 would fain have cried to him chokingly , held out her snowy slender arms 
 to him to come , to feel his lips laid on her white brow , the cry of a 
 young girl s love , a little strangled cry , wrung from her , that cry 
 that has rung through the ages . <end>   6.565466098781929
<start> <start> And then a rocket sprang and bang shot 
 blind blank and O ! <end>   2.856444778917237
<start> <start> then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh 
 of O ! <end>   9.760233549191186
<start> <start> O ! <end>   11.676290005981235
<start> <start> in raptures and it gushed out of it a 
 stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah ! <end>   5.086619273964388
<start> <start> they were all 
 greeny dewy stars falling with golden , O so lovely , O , soft , sweet , 
 soft ! <end>   6.920744272101722
<start> <start> Then all melted away dewily in the grey air : all was silent . <end>   5.422882366284777
<start> <start> Ah ! <end>   12.82916958857386
<start> <start> She 
 glanced at him as she bent forward quickly , a pathetic little glance of 
 piteous protest , of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl . <end>   5.478713182179544
<start> <start> He was leaning back against the rock behind . <end>   5.765249329060929
<start> <start> Leopold Bloom ( for it is 
 he ) stands silent , with bowed head before those young guileless eyes . <end>   5.59696183531551
<start> <start> What a brute he had been ! <end>   7.214996250010293
<start> <start> At it again ? <end>   11.702688696584927
<start> <start> A fair unsullied soul had called 
 to him and , wretch that he was , how had he answered ? <end>   7.00335993632429
<start> <start> An utter cad he 
 had been ! <end>   7.423689309833923
<start> <start> He of all men ! <end>   16.653911574368287
<start> <start> But there was an infinite store of mercy in 
 those eyes , for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and 
 sinned and wandered . <end>   7.5940570966064485
<start> <start> Should a girl tell ? <end>   9.62642805136659
<start> <start> No , a thousand times no . <end>   9.617000373760625
<start> <start> That 
 was their secret , only theirs , alone in the hiding twilight and there 
 was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly 
 through the evening to and fro and little bats don t tell . <end>   4.5452718509014085
<start> <start> Cissy Caffrey whistled , imitating the boys in the football field to 
 show what a great person she was : and then she cried : 
 
 Gerty ! <end>   7.532173402604252
<start> <start> Gerty ! <end>   29.293751542239
<start> <start> We re going . <end>   8.611275528340201

<start> <start> We can see from farther up . <end>   5.9294881442998255
<start> <start> Gerty had an idea , one of love s little ruses . <end>   9.039004593677673
<start> <start> She slipped a hand into 
 her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of 
 course without letting him and then slipped it back . <end>   4.921322392270757
<start> <start> Wonder if he s too 
 far to . <end>   11.022012148231195
<start> <start> She rose . <end>   11.95665382067077
<start> <start> Was it goodbye ? <end>   7.135835992242697
<start> <start> No . She had to go but they would meet 
 again , there , and she would dream of that till then , tomorrow , of her 
 dream of yester eve . <end>   8.239800100862402
<start> <start> She drew herself up to her full height . <end>   6.230309369592419
<start> <start> Their 
 souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her 
 heart , full of a strange shining , hung enraptured on her sweet 
 flowerlike face . <end>   5.300399629314123
<start> <start> She half smiled at him wanly , a sweet forgiving smile , 
 a smile that verged on tears , and then they parted . <end>   5.692357964076665
<start> <start> Slowly , without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy , 
 to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey , to little baby Boardman . <end>   5.305997305413495
<start> <start> It was 
 darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and 
 slippy seaweed . <end>   6.496112540643948

 of her but with care and very slowly because because Gerty MacDowell

 this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be 
 healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a

<start> <start> Also the lady 
 was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well

<start> <start> But 
 the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have 
 him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a 
 marvellous castle . <end>   5.067916575706842
<start> <start> And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for 
 to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches 
 environing in divers lands and sometime venery . <end>   3.0949116096440092
<start> <start> And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy 
 and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not 
 move more for enchantment . <end>   5.092627233398014
<start> <start> And on this board were frightful swords and 
 knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white 
 flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there 
 abound marvellously . <end>   4.105450251305576

<start> <start> And full fair cheer and rich was 
 on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer . <end>   3.3358719143264643
<start> <start> And there 
 was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay 
 strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be 
 possible thing without they see it natheless they are so . <end>   3.461535478661637

<start> <start> And 
 also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a 
 compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of 
 certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like 
 to a vast mountain . <end>   5.204820873473144
<start> <start> And they teach the serpents there to entwine 
 themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of 
 these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead . <end>   4.6407275555430845

 thereto the while all they that were there drank every each . <end>   2.018593331393543
<start> <start> And childe 
 Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat 
 in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and 
 anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and 
 his neighbour nist not of this wile . <end>   4.370405748048265

 hied fast . <end>   3.4079919947356667

 what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel , said he , 
 that it be not come or now . <end>   5.390667754327461
<start> <start> Meseems it dureth overlong . <end>   5.957658565227533
<start> <start> And he was ware 
 and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was 
 older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights 
 virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke 
 to him full gently . <end>   5.244761577931924
<start> <start> Also he took the cup that stood 
 tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to 
 drink and , Now drink , said he , fully delectably , and he quaffed as far 
 as he might to their both s health for he was a passing good man of his 
 lustiness . <end>   5.31835345436646
<start> <start> And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat 
 in scholars hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that 
 ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight 
 of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged 
 him courtly in the cup . <end>   4.31646336997192
<start> <start> Woman s woe with wonder pondering . <end>   5.1096601642375035
<start> <start> Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be 
 drunken an they might . <end>   7.928619631200424
<start> <start> There was a sort of scholars along either side 
 the board , that is to wit , Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary 
 Merciable s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden , scholars of 
 medicine , and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa , 
 one Crotthers , and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at 
 head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long 
 of a mastery of him erewhile gested ( and of all them , reserved young 
 Stephen , he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead ) and 
 beside the meek sir Leopold . <end>   4.659493351705759
<start> <start> But on young Malachi they waited for that 
 he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how 
 he had broke his avow . <end>   5.0474881404224705
<start> <start> Ruth red 
 him , love led on with will to wander , loth to leave . <end>   5.200931850298876
<start> <start> For they were right witty scholars . <end>   5.843370989167038
<start> <start> And he heard their aresouns each 
 gen other as touching birth and righteousness , young Madden maintaining 
 that put such case it were hard the wife to die ( for so it had fallen 
 out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne s house 
 that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next 
 before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her 
 case ) . <end>   3.779574798888899
<start> <start> And they said farther she should live because in the beginning , 
 they said , the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that 
 were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for 
 he had conscience to let her die . <end>   5.257136908655297
<start> <start> And not few and of these was young 
 Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it 
 was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the 
 law nor his judges did provide no remedy . <end>   3.485250108521556
<start> <start> A redress God grant . <end>   5.977731490125104
<start> <start> This was 
 scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay , by our Virgin Mother , 
 the wife should live and the babe to die . <end>   4.867243991258554
<start> <start> In colour whereof they waxed 
 hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but 
 the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at 
 the least way mirth might not lack . <end>   2.950124376754243
<start> <start> Then young Madden showed all the 
 whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion 
 sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint 
 Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby 
 they were all wondrous grieved . <end>   3.23288046078724
<start> <start> To whom young Stephen had these words 
 following : Murmur , sirs , is eke oft among lay folk . <end>   2.646815848285661
<start> <start> Both babe and 
 parent now glorify their Maker , the one in limbo gloom , the other in 
 purgefire . <end>   7.293711768769081
<start> <start> But , gramercy , what of those Godpossibled souls that we 
 nightly impossibilise , which is the sin against the Holy Ghost , Very 
 God , Lord and Giver of Life ? <end>   3.9564443751803746
<start> <start> For , sirs , he said , our lust is brief . <end>   5.299018134780331
<start> <start> We 
 are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends 
 than we . <end>   2.764120024273434
<start> <start> Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends . <end>   2.705034294354224
<start> <start> But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was 
 that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or 
 leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead . <end>   5.848293201068605
<start> <start> Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi s praise of that 
 beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn , the 
 other all this while , pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they 
 did malice him , witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his 
 engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to 
 do . <end>   3.8166234423373444
<start> <start> Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir 
 Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour 
 which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare 
 whoso she might be or wheresoever . <end>   4.161907401988739
<start> <start> Then spake young Stephen orgulous of 
 mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom , of law of canons , 
 of Lilith , patron of abortions , of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of 
 brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or , as Virgilius 
 saith , by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or 
 an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with , _effectu 
 secuto_ , or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of 
 Averroes and Moses Maimonides . <end>   4.387515437468607
<start> <start> He said also how at the end of the 
 second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother 
 foldeth ever souls for God s greater glory whereas that earthly mother 
 which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he 
 that holdeth the fisherman s seal , even that blessed Peter on which 
 rock was holy church for all ages founded . <end>   2.947763277249782
<start> <start> All they bachelors then 
 asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as 
 risk life to save life . <end>   3.366371594475951
<start> <start> A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted 
 all and , laying hand to jaw , he said dissembling , as his wont was , that 
 as it was informed him , who had ever loved the art of physic as might a 
 layman , and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an 
 accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had 
 birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their 
 questions . <end>   4.895195168735778
<start> <start> That is truth , pardy , said Dixon , and , or I err , a pregnant 
 word . <end>   7.05868853913875
<start> <start> Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he 
 averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he 
 was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that 
 taking it appeared eftsoons . <end>   7.0742134126092555
<start> <start> But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had 
 pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and 
 as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only 
 manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art 
 could save so dark is destiny . <end>   4.034872215231891
<start> <start> And she was wondrous stricken of heart 
 for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of 
 lamb s wool , the flower of the flock , lest he might perish utterly and 
 lie akeled ( for it was then about the midst of the winter ) and now sir 
 Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him 
 his friend s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness 
 and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage ( for 
 all accounted him of real parts ) so grieved he also in no less measure 
 for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and 
 murdered his goods with whores . <end>   5.177009776075567
<start> <start> About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty 
 so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed 
 their approach from him that still plied it very busily who , praying 
 for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff , he gave them for a pledge 
 the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray . <end>   3.6623452953286555
<start> <start> Now drink 
 we , quod he , of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed

<start> <start> See ye here . <end>   7.770953507224093
<start> <start> And he 
 showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the 
 worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had , he said , for a song 
 which he writ . <end>   5.84270147336474
<start> <start> They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such 
 dearth of money as was herebefore . <end>   3.4290405970667006
<start> <start> His words were then these as

 sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod

 Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was

 that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who 
 were no better off than himself . <end>   4.609202648180363
<start> <start> But the slap and 
 the blessing stood him friend , says Mr Vincent , for to make up he 
 taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid , wife , abbess 
 and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the 
 month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the 
 nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young 
 ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland . <end>   5.516588309725281
<start> <start> Another then put in his 
 word : And they dressed him , says he , in a point shift and petticoat 
 with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his 
 forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables 
 for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of 
 the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his 
 heart s content . <end>   5.212185009966818
<start> <start> By this time the father of the faithful ( for so they 
 called him ) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture . <end>   5.142912653665867
<start> <start> To 
 remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in 
 their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on 
 his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow 
 out of him in bulls language and they all after him . <end>   3.20958512071701
<start> <start> Ay , says another , 
 and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the 
 land but green grass for himself ( for that was the only colour to his 
 mind ) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the 
 island with a printed notice , saying : By the Lord Harry , Green is the 
 grass that grows on the ground . <end>   6.368795308415741
<start> <start> And , says Mr Dixon , if ever he got 
 scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a 
 husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or 
 a bag of rapeseed out he d run amok over half the countryside rooting 
 up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry s orders . <end>   4.001486019898034
<start> <start> There was bad blood between them at first , says Mr Vincent , and the 
 lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an 
 old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I ll meddle in 
 his matters , says he . <end>   5.957477175112548
<start> <start> I ll make that animal smell hell , says he , with 
 the help of that good pizzle my father left me . <end>   4.914529669317535
<start> <start> But one evening , says 
 Mr Dixon , when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to 
 dinner after winning a boatrace ( he had spade oars for himself but the 
 first rule of the course was that the others were to row with 
 pitchforks ) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and 
 on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he 
 found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous 
 champion bull of the Romans , _Bos Bovum_ , which is good bog Latin for 
 boss of the show . <end>   5.482984823586618
<start> <start> After that , says Mr Vincent , the lord Harry put his 
 head into a cow s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers 
 and pulling it out again told them all his new name . <end>   7.330599118008696
<start> <start> Then , with the 
 water running off him , he got into an old smock and skirt that had 
 belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls language 
 to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first 
 personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if 
 ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write 
 it upon what took his fancy , the side of a rock or a teahouse table or 
 a bale of cotton or a corkfloat . <end>   5.486935851341745
<start> <start> In short , he and the bull of Ireland 
 were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt . <end>   6.848999764010688
<start> <start> They were , says Mr 
 Stephen , and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was 
 toward , as the ungrate women were all of one mind , made a wherry raft , 
 loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard , set all 
 masts erect , manned the yards , sprang their luff , heaved to , spread 
 three sheets in the wind , put her head between wind and water , weighed 
 anchor , ported her helm , ran up the jolly Roger , gave three times 
 three , let the bullgine run , pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea 
 to recover the main of America . <end>   3.767218070364568
<start> <start> Which was the occasion , says Mr 
 Vincent , of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty : 
 
 _ Pope Peter s but a pissabed . <end>   5.999304499491222
<start> <start> A man s a man for a that . _ 
 
 Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway 
 as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend 
 whom he had just rencountered , a young gentleman , his name Alec Bannon , 
 who had late come to town , it being his intention to buy a colour or a 
 cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars . <end>   5.766527576292761
<start> <start> Mr Mulligan was civil 
 enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a 
 project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched 
 on . <end>   6.47443565642678
<start> <start> Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards 
 which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell s bearing a legend 
 printed in fair italics : _Mr Malachi Mulligan . <end>   2.8318063713784016
<start> <start> Fertiliser and 
 Incubator . <end>   17.63012868790323
<start> <start> Lambay Island_ . <end>   14.541640879995175
<start> <start> His project , as he went on to expound , was 
 to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief 
 business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and 
 to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has 
 been framed . <end>   4.648258924234417
<start> <start> Well , let us hear of it , good my friend , said Mr Dixon . <end>   6.604952879165682
<start> <start> I 
 make no doubt it smacks of wenching . <end>   4.432259484839892
<start> <start> Come , be seated , both . <end>   6.296936585151647
<start> <start> Tis as 
 cheap sitting as standing . <end>   5.9566998988574875
<start> <start> Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and , 
 expatiating upon his design , told his hearers that he had been led into 
 this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility , both the 
 inhibitory and the prohibitory , whether the inhibition in its turn were 
 due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as 
 whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from 
 proclivities acquired . <end>   4.828542998266073
<start> <start> It grieved him plaguily , he said , to see the 
 nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges : and to reflect upon so 
 many agreeable females with rich jointures , a prey to the vilest 
 bonzes , who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial 
 cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some 
 unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness , 
 sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty 
 fellows were at hand to caress , this , he assured them , made his heart 
 weep . <end>   3.597653501641767
<start> <start> To curb this inconvenient ( which he concluded due to a 
 suppression of latent heat ) , having advised with certain counsellors of 
 worth and inspected into this matter , he had resolved to purchase in 
 fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder , lord 
 Talbot de Malahide , a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our 
 ascendancy party . <end>   3.302798901274268
<start> <start> He proposed to set up there a national fertilising 
 farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the 
 fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the 
 fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there 
 direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her 
 natural . <end>   3.81832471103674
<start> <start> Money was no object , he said , nor would he take a penny for 
 his pains . <end>   8.798167634044878
<start> <start> The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of 
 fashion , if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm 
 persuaders for their petitions , would find in him their man . <end>   3.2829112534330416
<start> <start> For his 
 nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet 
 of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there , the flesh of these 
 latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose , both 
 broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum 
 chillies . <end>   3.3743942033995182
<start> <start> After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of 
 asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief 
 with which he had shielded it . <end>   5.163289356243856
<start> <start> They both , it seems , had been overtaken 
 by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water , as 
 might be observed by Mr Mulligan s smallclothes of a hodden grey which 
 was now somewhat piebald . <end>   5.256340186505142
<start> <start> His project meanwhile was very favourably 
 entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr 
 Dixon of Mary s excepted to it , asking with a finicking air did he 
 purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle . <end>   3.305701209843363
<start> <start> Mr Mulligan however made 
 court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which , as 
 it dwelt upon his memory , seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of 
 his contention : _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi , O quirites , ut 
 matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici 
 titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus 
 centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_ , while for those of ruder 
 wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more 
 suitable to their stomach , the buck and doe of the forest glade , the 
 farmyard drake and duck . <end>   2.987172285893021
<start> <start> Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance , being indeed a proper 
 man of person , this talkative now applied himself to his dress with 
 animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics 
 while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had 
 advanced . <end>   4.562834042671092
<start> <start> The young gentleman , his friend , overjoyed as he was at a 
 passage that had late befallen him , could not forbear to tell it his 
 nearest neighbour . <end>   6.303335647152995
<start> <start> Mr Mulligan , now perceiving the table , asked for 
 whom were those loaves and fishes and , seeing the stranger , he made him 
 a civil bow and said , Pray , sir , was you in need of any professional 
 assistance we could give ? <end>   5.781562372280054
<start> <start> Who , upon his offer , thanked him very 
 heartily , though preserving his proper distance , and replied that he 
 was come there about a lady , now an inmate of Horne s house , that was 
 in an interesting condition , poor body , from woman s woe ( and here he 
 fetched a deep sigh ) to know if her happiness had yet taken place . <end>   4.3232645972643375
<start> <start> Mr 
 Dixon , to turn the table , took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether 
 his incipient ventripotence , upon which he rallied him , betokened an 
 ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due , 
 as with the noted physician , Mr Austin Meldon , to a wolf in the 
 stomach . <end>   5.973103732997111
<start> <start> For answer Mr Mulligan , in a gale of laughter at his smalls , 
 smote himself bravely below the diaphragm , exclaiming with an admirable 
 droll mimic of Mother Grogan ( the most excellent creature of her sex 
 though tis pity she s a trollop ) : There s a belly that never bore a 
 bastard . <end>   3.807220223124307
<start> <start> This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth 
 and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight . <end>   3.956113079500167
<start> <start> The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some 
 larum in the antechamber . <end>   5.078343988016701
<start> <start> Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student , a little 
 fume of a fellow , blond as tow , congratulated in the liveliest fashion 
 with the young gentleman and , interrupting the narrative at a salient 
 point , having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the 
 obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by 
 a questioning poise of the head ( a whole century of polite breeding had 
 not achieved so nice a gesture ) to which was united an equivalent but 
 contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was 
 ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it . <end>   4.820548016451294
<start> <start> _Mais bien 
 sûr_ , noble stranger , said he cheerily , _et mille compliments_ . <end>   2.7229558530003874
<start> <start> That 
 you may and very opportunely . <end>   7.455793611017519
<start> <start> There wanted nothing but this cup to 
 crown my felicity . <end>   5.167102691646772
<start> <start> But , gracious heaven , was I left with but a crust in 
 my wallet and a cupful of water from the well , my God , I would accept 
 of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give 
 thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver 
 of good things . <end>   6.6692639658289705
<start> <start> With these words he approached the goblet to his lips , 
 took a complacent draught of the cordial , slicked his hair and , opening 
 his bosom , out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband , that very 
 picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein . <end>   4.7677001218792325
<start> <start> Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness , Ah , Monsieur , he 
 said , had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting 
 instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap ( a gift for her 
 feastday as she told me prettily ) in such an artless disorder , of so 
 melting a tenderness , pon my conscience , even you , Monsieur , had been 
 impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands 
 of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever . <end>   3.7709308921346727
<start> <start> I declare , I was never 
 so touched in all my life . <end>   9.462212511047067
<start> <start> God , I thank thee , as the Author of my days ! <end>   6.589343783140354
<start> <start> Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her 
 favours . <end>   3.2998901547724993
<start> <start> A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and , having 
 replaced the locket in his bosom , he wiped his eye and sighed again . <end>   4.1495394988035486
<start> <start> Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures , how great 
 and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in 
 thrall the free and the bond , the simple swain and the polished 
 coxcomb , the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of 
 maturer years . <end>   4.834610882502147
<start> <start> But indeed , sir , I wander from the point . <end>   12.51805840699006
<start> <start> How mingled 
 and imperfect are all our sublunary joys . <end>   5.319666205068767
<start> <start> Maledicity ! <end>   35.49369557982899
<start> <start> he exclaimed in 
 anguish . <end>   11.47147370456017
<start> <start> Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my 
 cloak along ! <end>   5.011132696942647
<start> <start> I could weep to think of it . <end>   5.571705656736412
<start> <start> Then , though it had poured 
 seven showers , we were neither of us a penny the worse . <end>   5.083131137978204
<start> <start> But beshrew me , 
 he cried , clapping hand to his forehead , tomorrow will be a new day 
 and , thousand thunders , I know of a _marchand de capotes_ , Monsieur 
 Poyntz , from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the 
 French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting . <end>   4.9618403192019285

 Fécondateur , tripping in , my friend Monsieur Moore , that most 
 accomplished traveller ( I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in 
 a circle of the best wits of the town ) , is my authority that in Cape 
 Horn , _ventre biche_ , they have a rain that will wet through any , even 
 the stoutest cloak . <end>   4.409228241147326

 posthaste to another world . <end>   3.4087927850756516

 cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of 
 our store of knowledge . <end>   3.7676080011221944

 all were conjecturing what might be the cause , Miss Callan entered and ,

 party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and

 ribaldry . <end>   3.99322928953733

<start> <start> Having 
 delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and 
 repaired to the door . <end>   5.614787778172287
<start> <start> A murmur of approval arose from all and some were 
 for ejecting the low soaker without more ado , a design which would have 
 been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had 
 he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid 
 imprecation ( for he swore a round hand ) that he was as good a son of 
 the true fold as ever drew breath . <end>   3.7558510677203008

 Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch 
 that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity , born 
 out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into 
 the world , which the dint of the surgeon s pliers in his skull lent 
 indeed a colour to , so as to put him in thought of that missing link of 
 creation s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin . <end>   4.641918251290919

 now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had 
 passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and , being of a 
 wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast , he had enjoined his 
 heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and , by intercepting 
 them with the readiest precaution , foster within his breast that 
 plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at , rash judgers scorn 
 and all find tolerable and but tolerable . <end>   4.196378700752071
<start> <start> To those who create 
 themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy ( a habit of mind which 
 he never did hold with ) to them he would concede neither to bear the 
 name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding : while for such 
 that , having lost all forbearance , can lose no more , there remained the 
 sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a 
 precipitate and inglorious retreat . <end>   3.641527676661681
<start> <start> Not but what he could feel with 
 mettlesome youth which , caring nought for the mows of dotards or the 
 gruntlings of the severe , is ever ( as the chaste fancy of the Holy 
 Writer expresses it ) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far 
 forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a 
 gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions . <end>   4.7016871070283415
<start> <start> To conclude , while 
 from the sister s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was , 
 however , it must be owned , not a little alleviated by the intelligence 
 that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now 
 testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the 
 Supreme Being . <end>   5.7187193435617125
<start> <start> Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour , saying that , to express 
 his notion of the thing , his opinion ( who ought not perchance to 
 express one ) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid 
 genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her 
 confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers . <end>   5.568868605725662

 expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian 
 matron . <end>   4.524389399238812
<start> <start> I must acquaint you , said Mr Crotthers , clapping on the table 
 so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis , old Glory Allelujurum 
 was round again today , an elderly man with dundrearies , preferring 
 through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina , my life , as he 
 calls her . <end>   4.580622481258561

<start> <start> All fell to praising of it , each after his own 
 fashion , though the same young blade held with his former view that 
 another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap , a clerk in 
 orders , a linkboy ( virtuous ) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed 
 in every household . <end>   5.023569988138246
<start> <start> Singular , communed the guest with himself , the 
 wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them , that 
 the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the 
 seminaries of such frivolity , that the mere acquisition of academic 
 titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of 
 levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise 
 eminent have esteemed the noblest . <end>   3.6652535965911976
<start> <start> But , he further added , it is mayhap 
 to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have 
 more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together . <end>   4.628506816964926

 afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic

 exhaustion and approbation the delegates , chafing under the length and 
 solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would 
 palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and

 successively eviscerated : the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers , 
 the Caesarean section , posthumity with respect to the father and , that 
 rarer form , with respect to the mother , the fratricidal case known as 
 the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr 
 Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused , 
 the rights of primogeniture and king s bounty touching twins and 
 triplets , miscarriages and infanticides , simulated or dissimulated , the 
 acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion , the 
 agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen ( cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan ) 
 in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the 
 medial line so that ( as he said ) one ear could hear what the other 
 spoke , the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep , the prolongation 
 of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the 
 vein , the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid ( as exemplified in 
 the actual case ) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix , 
 artificial insemination by means of syringes , involution of the womb 
 consequent upon the menopause , the problem of the perpetration of the 
 species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape , that 
 distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers 
 _Sturzgeburt , _ the recorded instances of multiseminal , twikindled and 
 monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of 
 consanguineous parents in a word all the cases of human nativity which 
 Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic 
 illustrations . <end>   4.009872033472823
<start> <start> The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine 
 were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the 
 state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step 
 over a countrystile lest , by her movement , the navelcord should 
 strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a 
 yearning , ardently and ineffectually entertained , to place her hand 
 against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the 
 seat of castigation . <end>   4.013322629555179

 both these views , with such heat as almost carried conviction , the 
 theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes , his

 the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down 
 to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses . <end>   4.452950871117128

 submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus . <end>   2.9827081768052475

 priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law . <end>   4.600341172544177

 therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second 
 constellation . <end>   4.537503128151492
<start> <start> However , as a matter of fact though , the preposterous surmise about him 
 being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which 
 was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character , was 
 not the case at all . <end>   6.603542972341088
<start> <start> The individual whose visual organs while the above 
 was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of 
 animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody 
 that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty 
 speedily in the wrong shop . <end>   3.5990370174668667
<start> <start> During the past four minutes or thereabouts 
 he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled 
 by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton - on - Trent which happened to be situated 
 amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was 
 certainly calculated to attract anyone s remark on account of its 
 scarlet appearance . <end>   3.3687003368802517
<start> <start> He was simply and solely , as it subsequently 
 transpired for reasons best known to himself , which put quite an 
 altogether different complexion on the proceedings , after the moment 
 before s observations about boyhood days and the turf , recollecting two 
 or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as 
 mutually innocent of as the babe unborn . <end>   4.219425134474712
<start> <start> Eventually , however , both 
 their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other 
 was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily 
 determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the 
 neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid 
 sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out 
 with , also at the same time , however , a considerable degree of 
 attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it 
 about the place . <end>   6.57432291846125

<start> <start> Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity . <end>   3.1734057244235356
<start> <start> The 
 debaters were the keenest in the land , the theme they were engaged on 
 the loftiest and most vital . <end>   6.320988586890566
<start> <start> The high hall of Horne s house had never 
 beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old 
 rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so 
 encyclopaedic . <end>   3.5606838657698314
<start> <start> A gallant scene in truth it made . <end>   3.5574492470142087
<start> <start> Crotthers was there at 
 the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb , his face glowing 
 from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway . <end>   6.996058157583142
<start> <start> There too , opposite to 
 him , was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early 
 depravity and premature wisdom . <end>   3.688380231864933
<start> <start> Next the Scotchman was the place 
 assigned to Costello , the eccentric , while at his side was seated in 
 stolid repose the squat form of Madden . <end>   4.410369508539769
<start> <start> The chair of the resident 
 indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the 
 figure of Bannon in explorer s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide 
 brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred 
 manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan . <end>   2.7623718195844744
<start> <start> Lastly at the head of the 
 board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of 
 pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of 
 Socratic discussion , while to right and left of him were accommodated 
 the flippant prognosticator , fresh from the hippodrome , and that 
 vigilant wanderer , soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained 
 by the mire of an indelible dishonour , but from whose steadfast and 
 constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever 
 efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired 
 pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come . <end>   3.4078606073746696
<start> <start> It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted 
 transcendentalism to which Mr S . Dedalus ( Div . <end>   4.214482735490044
<start> <start> Scep . ) contentions 
 would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter 
 to accepted scientific methods . <end>   3.586979992836101
<start> <start> The man of science like the 
 man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked 
 and explain them as best he can . <end>   4.737488406661117
<start> <start> There may be , it is true , some 
 questions which science cannot answer at present such as the first 
 problem submitted by Mr L . Bloom ( Pubb . <end>   4.463052198615275
<start> <start> Canv . ) regarding the future 
 determination of sex . <end>   6.001906723103143
<start> <start> This would be tantamount to a cooperation ( one of nature s 
 favourite devices ) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on 
 the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position , _succubitus 
 felix_ , of the passive element . <end>   5.568983599052277
<start> <start> The other problem raised by the same 
 inquirer is scarcely less vital : infant mortality . <end>   2.8103180664866745
<start> <start> It is interesting 
 because , as he pertinently remarks , we are all born in the same way but 
 we all die in different ways . <end>   5.597409845110448
<start> <start> Mr M . Mulligan ( Hyg . <end>   6.531921638838021
<start> <start> et Eug . <end>   14.541640879995175

 the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract 
 adenoids , pulmonary complaints etc . <end>   3.803863659878551
<start> <start> by inhaling the bacteria which lurk 
 in dust . <end>   4.266627049245873
<start> <start> These factors , he alleged , and the revolting spectacles 
 offered by our streets , hideous publicity posters , religious ministers 
 of all denominations , mutilated soldiers and sailors , exposed scorbutic 
 cardrivers , the suspended carcases of dead animals , paranoic bachelors 
 and unfructified duennas these , he said , were accountable for any and 
 every fallingoff in the calibre of the race . <end>   3.738029296932256
<start> <start> Kalipedia , he prophesied , 
 would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life , genuinely 
 good music , agreeable literature , light philosophy , instructive 
 pictures , plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as 
 Venus and Apollo , artistic coloured photographs of prize babies , all 
 these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular 
 condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner . <end>   3.490125130470815
<start> <start> Mr 
 J . Crotthers ( Disc . <end>   7.2828464440959655
<start> <start> Bacc . ) attributes some of these demises to 
 abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy 
 labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by 
 far the vast majority to neglect , private or official , culminating in 
 the exposure of newborn infants , the practice of criminal abortion or 
 in the atrocious crime of infanticide . <end>   4.118359826721134
<start> <start> Although the former ( we are 
 thinking of neglect ) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of 
 nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too 
 rare to be normative . <end>   4.218175693621571
<start> <start> In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder 
 is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do , 
 all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which 
 often baulk nature in her intentions . <end>   5.09587673316779
<start> <start> An ingenious suggestion is that 
 thrown out by Mr V . Lynch ( Bacc . <end>   4.382700195178917
<start> <start> Arith . ) that both natality and 
 mortality , as well as all other phenomena of evolution , tidal 
 movements , lunar phases , blood temperatures , diseases in general , 
 everything , in fine , in nature s vast workshop from the extinction of 
 some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which 
 beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet 
 unascertained . <end>   4.2223446591672555
<start> <start> Still the plain straightforward question why a child of 
 normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly 
 looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood ( though other 
 children of the same marriage do not ) must certainly , in the poet s 
 words , give us pause . <end>   3.625675293805652
<start> <start> Nature , we may rest assured , has her own good and 
 cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths 
 are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous 
 germs have taken up their residence ( modern science has conclusively 
 shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal ) tend 
 to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development , an 
 arrangement which , though productive of pain to some of our feelings 
 ( notably the maternal ) , is nevertheless , some of us think , in the long 
 run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival 
 of the fittest . <end>   3.5074288122567734
<start> <start> Mr S . Dedalus ( Div . <end>   6.450592285938855

 called an interruption ? ) that an omnivorous being which can masticate , 
 deglute , digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with 
 pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous 
 females emaciated by parturition , corpulent professional gentlemen , not 
 to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns , might possibly 
 find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob , reveals 
 as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above 
 alluded to . <end>   2.9772412624477433

 acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this 
 morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening 
 bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid 
 from an alkali prides himself on being , it should perhaps be stated 
 that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed 
 victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly 
 dropped from its mother . <end>   2.879691903069506

 stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag ( an esthete s

 all nature s processes the act of sexual congress ) she must let it out 
 again or give it life , as he phrased it , to save her own . <end>   5.274409295609249

 means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned . <end>   3.968968658475025
<start> <start> So far as he could see he 
 was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly 
 advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in 
 their then condition , both of them being e . d . ed , particularly Stephen , 
 always assuming that there was such a thing to be found . <end>   5.716622763509363
<start> <start> Accordingly 
 after a few such preliminaries as brushing , in spite of his having 
 forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had 
 done yeoman service in the shaving line , they both walked together 
 along Beaver street or , more properly , lane as far as the farrier s and 
 the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of 
 Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence 
 debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin s . <end>   4.306418651950232
<start> <start> But 
 as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for 
 hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler , probably engaged by some 
 fellows inside on the spree , outside the North Star hotel and there was 
 no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom , who was 
 anything but a professional whistler , endeavoured to hail it by 
 emitting a kind of a whistle , holding his arms arched over his head , 
 twice . <end>   4.531547700652555
<start> <start> This was a quandary but , bringing common sense to bear on it , evidently 
 there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it 
 which they accordingly did . <end>   6.434883679636699
<start> <start> So , bevelling around by Mullett s and the 
 Signal House which they shortly reached , they proceeded perforce in the 
 direction of Amiens street railway terminus , Mr Bloom being handicapped 
 by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had , 
 to vary the timehonoured adage , gone the way of all buttons though , 
 entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing , he heroically made 
 light of the mischance . <end>   5.392501940489212
<start> <start> As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company s 
 sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his 
 companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of 
 some little while back . <end>   4.563443526642386
<start> <start> They passed the main entrance of the Great 
 Northern railway station , the starting point for Belfast , where of 
 course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the 
 backdoor of the morgue ( a not very enticing locality , not to say 
 gruesome to a degree , more especially at night ) ultimately gained the 
 Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street , famous for its 
 C division police station . <end>   3.925553260471267
<start> <start> Between this point and the high at present 
 unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen , 
 associated with Baird s the stonecutter s in his mind somehow in Talbot 
 place , first turning on the right , while the other who was acting as 
 his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of 
 James Rourke s city bakery , situated quite close to where they were , 
 the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread , of all commodities 
 of the public the primary and most indispensable . <end>   4.584310445597794
<start> <start> Bread , the staff of 
 life , earn your bread , O tell me where is fancy bread , at Rourke s the 
 baker s it is said . <end>   7.660354172635945
<start> <start> _En route_ to his taciturn and , not to put too fine a point on it , not 
 yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in 
 complete possession of his faculties , never more so , in fact 
 disgustingly sober , spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of 
 nighttown , women of ill fame and swell mobsmen , which , barely 
 permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice , was of 
 the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age 
 particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence 
 of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as 
 even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if 
 you didn t look out . <end>   4.480163154175042
<start> <start> Highly providential was the appearance on the 
 scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for 
 that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might 
 have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or , 
 failing that , the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day 
 before Mr Tobias or , he being the solicitor rather , old Wall , he meant 
 to say , or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got 
 bruited about . <end>   5.619194870679474
<start> <start> The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those 
 policemen , whom he cordially disliked , were admittedly unscrupulous in 
 the service of the Crown and , as Mr Bloom put it , recalling a case or 
 two in the A division in Clanbrassil street , prepared to swear a hole 
 through a ten gallon pot . <end>   5.109033190843422
<start> <start> Another thing he commented on was equipping 
 soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off 
 at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians 
 should by any chance they fall out over anything . <end>   2.69652487672078
<start> <start> You frittered away 
 your time , he very sensibly maintained , and health and also character 
 besides which , the squandermania of the thing , fast women of the 
 _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of . <end>   6.3589263336357655
<start> <start> d . <end>   17.583389079856936
<start> <start> into the bargain and the 
 greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though , touching the 
 much vexed question of stimulants , he relished a glass of choice old 
 wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing 
 aperient virtues ( notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch 
 believer in ) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably 
 drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of 
 your being at the tender mercy of others practically . <end>   3.7343872023680147
<start> <start> Most of all he 
 commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting 
 _confrères_ but one , a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his 
 brother medicos under all the circs . <end>   6.608611682111661
<start> <start> And that one was Judas , Stephen said , who up to then had said nothing 
 whatsoever of any kind . <end>   4.817806613571106
<start> <start> Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back 
 of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a 
 brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one 
 attracted their rather lagging footsteps . <end>   4.205746670769929
<start> <start> He began to remember that this had happened or had 
 been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small 
 effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a 
 _quondam_ friend of his father s , Gumley . <end>   4.269660006235362
<start> <start> To avoid a meeting he drew 
 nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge . <end>   6.252028613662005
<start> <start> Someone saluted you , Mr Bloom said . <end>   5.312395142715422
<start> <start> A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches 
 saluted again , calling : 
 
 Night ! <end>   4.829704216469674
<start> <start> Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the 
 compliment . <end>   6.2977769405879105
<start> <start> Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch 
 as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but 
 nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety 
 though not funkyish in the least . <end>   3.1879734369878494
<start> <start> Though unusual in the Dublin area he 
 knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next 
 to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising 
 peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some 
 secluded spot outside the city proper , famished loiterers of the Thames 
 embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply 
 marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell 
 swoop at a moment s notice , your money or your life , leaving you there 
 to point a moral , gagged and garrotted . <end>   3.319514847045654
<start> <start> Stephen , that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters , 
 though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley s 
 breath redolent of rotten cornjuice . <end>   5.070789259571619
<start> <start> Lord John Corley some called him 
 and his genealogy came about in this wise . <end>   6.287132428823823
<start> <start> He was the eldest son of 
 inspector Corley of the G division , lately deceased , who had married a 
 certain Katherine Brophy , the daughter of a Louth farmer . <end>   6.480589680993144
<start> <start> His 
 grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of 
 a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine ( also ) Talbot . <end>   2.676312213440525
<start> <start> Rumour had it ( though not proved ) that she descended from the house of 
 the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion , really an unquestionably 
 fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing , her mother or aunt or 
 some relative , a woman , as the tale went , of extreme beauty , had 
 enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen . <end>   4.368067900751559
<start> <start> This 
 therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though 
 dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with 
 facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley . <end>   2.8299875005094393
<start> <start> Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell . <end>   4.612844106448993
<start> <start> Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night s lodgings . <end>   4.423394952975621
<start> <start> His friends 
 had all deserted him . <end>   6.181359664569667
<start> <start> Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called 
 him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of 
 other uncalledfor expressions . <end>   6.7756655427324946
<start> <start> He was out of a job and implored of 
 Stephen to tell him where on God s earth he could get something , 
 anything at all , to do . <end>   8.374281351875492
<start> <start> No , it was the daughter of the mother in the 
 washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they 
 were connected through the mother in some way , both occurrences 
 happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn t a complete 
 fabrication from start to finish . <end>   5.891345020586716
<start> <start> Anyhow he was all in . <end>   20.090958878164408
<start> <start> I wouldn t ask you only , pursued he , on my solemn oath and God knows 
 I m on the rocks . <end>   6.051116173861319
<start> <start> There ll be a job tomorrow or next day , Stephen told him , in a boys 
 school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher . <end>   7.89753364620977
<start> <start> Mr Garrett Deasy . <end>   8.375590431174212
<start> <start> Try it . <end>   8.849298670441556
<start> <start> You 
 may mention my name . <end>   4.995367263593391
<start> <start> Ah , God , Corley replied , sure I couldn t teach in a school , man . <end>   5.778366070778606
<start> <start> I was 
 never one of your bright ones , he added with a half laugh . <end>   8.702060990811349
<start> <start> I got stuck 
 twice in the junior at the christian brothers . <end>   8.901518751234759
<start> <start> I have no place to sleep myself , Stephen informed him . <end>   5.599413562236346
<start> <start> Corley at the first go - off was inclined to suspect it was something to 
 do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody 
 tart off the street . <end>   5.751640097022997
<start> <start> There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street , Mrs 
 Maloney s , but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but 
 M Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over 
 in Winetavern street ( which was distantly suggestive to the person 
 addressed of friar Bacon ) for a bob . <end>   4.570727227553848
<start> <start> He was starving too though he 
 hadn t said a word about it . <end>   4.747870425276093
<start> <start> Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it 
 still Stephen s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he 
 knew that Corley s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was 
 hardly deserving of much credence . <end>   5.050356384308465
<start> <start> However _haud ignarus malorum 
 miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially 
 as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the 
 month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of 
 fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished . <end>   4.277769744292403
<start> <start> But the cream 
 of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley s head that he was 
 living in affluence and hadn t a thing to do but hand out the needful . <end>   5.265534750845632
<start> <start> Whereas . <end>   29.86528825701652
<start> <start> He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of 
 finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a 
 bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get 
 sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for , to his 
 chagrin , he found his cash missing . <end>   5.545699148730767
<start> <start> A few broken biscuits were all the 
 result of his investigation . <end>   8.980253097371309
<start> <start> He tried his hardest to recollect for the 
 moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in 
 that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout , very much the reverse 
 in fact . <end>   5.396815836593356
<start> <start> He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough 
 search though he tried to recollect . <end>   3.240208990699007
<start> <start> About biscuits he dimly 
 remembered . <end>   4.0022520936625305
<start> <start> Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did 
 he buy . <end>   4.435316906019574
<start> <start> However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in 
 the dark were pennies , erroneously however , as it turned out . <end>   5.223355868608764
<start> <start> Those are halfcrowns , man , Corley corrected him . <end>   4.094474625466812
<start> <start> And so in point of fact they turned out to be . <end>   4.906244145112497
<start> <start> Thanks , Corley answered , you re a gentleman . <end>   7.25884713597366
<start> <start> I ll pay you back one 
 time . <end>   5.1304949048084305
<start> <start> Who s that with you ? <end>   12.678495830736344
<start> <start> I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse 
 in Camden street with Boylan , the billsticker . <end>   8.140932966904105
<start> <start> You might put in a good 
 word for us to get me taken on there . <end>   7.066767102190916
<start> <start> I d carry a sandwichboard only 
 the girl in the office told me they re full up for the next three 
 weeks , man . <end>   7.670199896584951
<start> <start> God , you ve to book ahead , man , you d think it was for the 
 Carl Rosa . <end>   7.134940821532209
<start> <start> I don t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job , even as 
 a crossing sweeper . <end>   5.029644794751365
<start> <start> Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six 
 he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky 
 that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam s , the shipchandler s , 
 bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle s back with 
 O Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe . <end>   6.418828027714834
<start> <start> Anyhow he 
 was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and 
 disorderly and refusing to go with the constable . <end>   4.887479476560691
<start> <start> Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the 
 cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation 
 watchman s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work , it struck him , 
 was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own 
 private account while Dublin slept . <end>   4.099096320951184
<start> <start> He threw an odd eye at the same 
 time now and then at Stephen s anything but immaculately attired 
 interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though 
 where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the 
 remotest idea when . <end>   4.756389697197386
<start> <start> Being a levelheaded individual who could give 
 points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on 
 his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally 
 testifying to a chronic impecuniosity . <end>   3.244053675436386
<start> <start> Palpably he was one of his 
 hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one 
 preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round , in every deep , so to put 
 it , a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street 
 chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the 
 option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether . <end>   7.503946181813713
<start> <start> In any case he 
 had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that 
 hour of the night or morning . <end>   5.549326656491997
<start> <start> Pretty thick that was certainly . <end>   9.798417524711173
<start> <start> The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who , with his 
 practised eye , was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the 
 blandiloquence of the other parasite . <end>   6.967507656026184
<start> <start> Alluding to the encounter he 
 said , laughingly , Stephen , that is : 
 
 He is down on his luck . <end>   9.935278963974577
<start> <start> He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named 
 Boylan , a billsticker , to give him a job as a sandwichman . <end>   6.885943794938666
<start> <start> At this intelligence , in which he seemingly evinced little interest , Mr 
 Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the 
 direction of a bucketdredger , rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana , 
 moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair , 
 whereupon he observed evasively : 
 
 Everybody gets their own ration of luck , they say . <end>   4.925079368829627
<start> <start> Now you mention it 
 his face was familiar to me . <end>   8.618584973590327
<start> <start> But , leaving that for the moment , how much 
 did you part with , he queried , if I am not too inquisitive ? <end>   6.899262890439975
<start> <start> I daresay he needs it to sleep 
 somewhere . <end>   5.026623016596143
<start> <start> Mr Bloom ejaculated , professing not the least surprise at the 
 intelligence , I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he 
 invariably does . <end>   5.047396337485885
<start> <start> Everyone according to his needs or everyone according 
 to his deeds . <end>   6.3441029720553015
<start> <start> But , talking about things in general , where , added he 
 with a smile , will you sleep yourself ? <end>   5.8770743382909
<start> <start> Walking to Sandycove is out of 
 the question . <end>   7.565488834884843
<start> <start> And even supposing you did you won t get in after what 
 occurred at Westland Row station . <end>   4.621415313571917
<start> <start> Simply fag out there for nothing . <end>   7.491254169259043
<start> <start> I 
 don t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why 
 did you leave your father s house ? <end>   4.901935366581761
<start> <start> To seek misfortune , was Stephen s answer . <end>   6.67771797083487
<start> <start> I met your respected father on a recent occasion , Mr Bloom 
 diplomatically returned , today in fact , or to be strictly accurate , on 
 yesterday . <end>   5.080712046189291
<start> <start> Where does he live at present ? <end>   5.333808801030981
<start> <start> I gathered in the course of 
 conversation that he had moved . <end>   11.237876480807289
<start> <start> I believe he is in Dublin somewhere , Stephen answered unconcernedly . <end>   9.493203521995717
<start> <start> Why ? <end>   9.657286058959233
<start> <start> A gifted man , Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior , in more respects 
 than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one . <end>   6.396301223472501
<start> <start> He takes great 
 pride , quite legitimate , out of you . <end>   4.437570745318751
<start> <start> You could go back perhaps , he 
 hasarded , still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row 
 terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two , Mulligan , 
 that is , and that English tourist friend of his , who eventually euchred 
 their third companion , were patently trying as if the whole bally 
 station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion , 
 which they did . <end>   5.595565122074225
<start> <start> There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however , such as it 
 was , Stephen s mind s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his 
 family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by 
 the ingle , her hair hanging down , waiting for some weak Trinidad shell 
 cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he 
 could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings 
 they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy , Boody and 
 Katey , the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells 
 and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper , in 
 accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on 
 the days commanded , it being quarter tense or if not , ember days or 
 something like that . <end>   4.778342035861634
<start> <start> No , Mr Bloom repeated again , I wouldn t personally repose much trust 
 in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element , 
 Dr Mulligan , as a guide , philosopher and friend if I were in your 
 shoes . <end>   4.690736470113557
<start> <start> He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all 
 probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals . <end>   3.727156090076519
<start> <start> Of course you didn t notice as much as I did . <end>   4.527427985492491
<start> <start> But it wouldn t occasion 
 me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic 
 was put in your drink for some ulterior object . <end>   4.531711106507794
<start> <start> He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a 
 versatile allround man , by no means confined to medicine only , who was 
 rapidly coming to the fore in his line and , if the report was verified , 
 bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future 
 as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services 
 in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from 
 certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid 
 at Skerries , or Malahide was it ? , was , he was bound to admit , an 
 exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise , so that 
 frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be

<start> <start> The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by 
 friendliness which he gave at Stephen s at present morose expression of 
 features did not throw a flood of light , none at all in fact on the 
 problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge 
 by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about 
 saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to 
 himself allowed matters to more or less . <end>   4.175925635887308

 Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman s shelter , an unpretentious 
 wooden structure , where , prior to then , he had rarely if ever been 
 before , the former having previously whispered to the latter a few 
 hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin - the - Goat 
 Fitzharris , the invincible , though he could not vouch for the actual 
 facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in . <end>   4.58080418163141
<start> <start> A few 
 moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet 
 corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous 
 collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the 
 genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified 
 by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked 
 curiosity . <end>   2.5112695312260067
<start> <start> Now touching a cup of coffee , Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest 
 to break the ice , it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the 
 shape of solid food , say , a roll of some description . <end>   4.9373136002671325
<start> <start> Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order 
 these commodities quietly . <end>   3.091891564779906
<start> <start> The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or 
 whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes 
 apparently dissatisfied , away though one redbearded bibulous 
 individual , portion of whose hair was greyish , a sailor probably , still 
 stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention 
 to the floor . <end>   2.4784475270483624
<start> <start> Mr Bloom , availing himself of the right of free speech , 
 he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute , 
 though , to be sure , rather in a quandary over _voglio_ , remarked to his 
 _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in 
 the street which was still raging fast and furious :

 Stephen , who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could , suffering

<start> <start> Mr Bloom asked . <end>   5.521966175751442
<start> <start> Of course , he subjoined pensively , at the 
 inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were 
 absolutely necessary , it may be only the southern glamour that 
 surrounds it . <end>   3.633546743847725
<start> <start> The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête - à - tête_ put a 
 boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the 
 table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun , or so it seemed . <end>   5.460742216275842
<start> <start> After which he beat a retreat to his counter , Mr Bloom determining to 
 have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to . <end>   5.3400881229889
<start> <start> For 
 which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he 
 did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was 
 temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him . <end>   4.779367892035676

<start> <start> Of course . <end>   11.793260608661521
<start> <start> Our name 
 was changed too , he added , pushing the socalled roll across . <end>   5.179582251400802
<start> <start> The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded 
 Stephen , whom he had singled out for attention in particular , squarely 
 by asking : 
 
 And what might your name be ? <end>   3.9620117409306825
<start> <start> Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion s boot but 
 Stephen , apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected 
 quarter , answered : 
 
 Dedalus . <end>   4.57071022683645
<start> <start> The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes , 
 rather bunged up from excessive use of boose , preferably good old 
 Hollands and water . <end>   3.931901255382808
<start> <start> You know Simon Dedalus ? <end>   8.914330344426741
<start> <start> he asked at length . <end>   5.918321175072485
<start> <start> I ve heard of him , Stephen said . <end>   8.977677345841366
<start> <start> Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment , seeing the others evidently 
 eavesdropping too . <end>   4.619759123366145
<start> <start> He s Irish , the seaman bold affirmed , staring still in much the same 
 way and nodding . <end>   5.647716080884834
<start> <start> All Irish . <end>   12.705555927623646
<start> <start> All too Irish , Stephen rejoined . <end>   10.541439266829201
<start> <start> As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole 
 business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when 
 the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the 
 shelter with the remark : 
 
 I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his 
 shoulder . <end>   5.148245211421193
<start> <start> Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his 
 gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain . <end>   5.42975059816506
<start> <start> Bottles out there , say . <end>   9.927608293148596

<start> <start> Aims . <end>   35.49369557982899
<start> <start> He turned his body half round , shut up his right eye completely . <end>   3.759238170887894
<start> <start> Then 
 he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the 
 night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance . <end>   4.1203459895641386
<start> <start> Pom ! <end>   23.629578267932814
<start> <start> he then shouted once . <end>   8.047244167439313
<start> <start> The entire audience waited , anticipating an additional detonation , 
 there being still a further egg . <end>   3.660463940068727
<start> <start> Pom ! <end>   23.629578267932814
<start> <start> he shouted twice . <end>   9.590481625006012
<start> <start> Egg two evidently demolished , he nodded and winked , adding 
 bloodthirstily : 
 
 _ Buffalo Bill shoots to kill , 
 
 Never missed nor he never will . _ 
 
 A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness sake just felt like 
 asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the 
 Bisley . <end>   4.112092375341288
<start> <start> Beg pardon , the sailor said . <end>   7.5640916933102496
<start> <start> Long ago ? <end>   12.00324122750517
<start> <start> Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth . <end>   3.4485446501072876
<start> <start> Why , the sailor replied , relaxing to a certain extent under the magic 
 influence of diamond cut diamond , it might be a matter of ten years . <end>   4.911916198886653
<start> <start> He 
 toured the wide world with Hengler s Royal Circus . <end>   2.7158558885699517
<start> <start> I seen him do that 
 in Stockholm . <end>   12.69162377146312

 detected a discrepancy between his name ( assuming he was the person he 
 represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after 
 having boxed the compass on the strict q . t . somewhere ) and the 
 fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some 
 suspicions of our friend s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in 
 a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some 
 Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say 
 that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was 
 at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had 
 consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead

 concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure

 Eastbourne , Scarborough , Margate and so on , beautiful Bournemouth , the

<start> <start> That was the rub . <end>   6.463916904300551
<start> <start> Also , without being actually positive , it struck him a great field was 
 to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with 
 the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard - Rosslare route which , it was 
 mooted , was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments 
 with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete 
 fogeydom and dunderheads generally . <end>   4.796369811517255
<start> <start> A great opportunity there certainly 
 was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public 
 at large , the average man , i . e . Brown , Robinson and Co . 
 
 It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no 
 small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street , when the 
 system really needed toning up , for the matter of a couple of paltry 
 pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead 
 of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick - in - the - mud took 
 me for a wife . <end>   4.389703504050307

 her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life . <end>   4.012621538888657
<start> <start> There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home 
 island , delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation , offering a plethora 
 of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around 
 Dublin and its picturesque environs even , Poulaphouca to which there 
 was a steamtram , but also farther away from the madding crowd in 
 Wicklow , rightly termed the garden of Ireland , an ideal neighbourhood 
 for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn t come down , and in the wilds 
 of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d œil_ was exceedingly 
 grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that 
 the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering 
 the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic 
 associations and otherwise , Silken Thomas , Grace O Malley , George IV , 
 rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt 
 with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when 
 young men s fancy , though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off 
 the cliffs by design or accidentally , usually , by the way , on their 
 left leg , it being only about three quarters of an hour s run from the 
 pillar . <end>   3.6140096480972366

 desired . <end>   5.268441237720105
<start> <start> Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of 
 curiosity , pure and simple , was whether it was the traffic that created 
 the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact . <end>   5.402036896005804

 questions even should they by any chance want to . <end>   2.5389289860965842

 _stiletto_ . <end>   3.704307438464337

<start> <start> At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance is 
 bliss_ Mr B . and Stephen , each in his own particular way , both 
 instinctively exchanged meaning glances , in a religious silence of the 
 strictly _entre nous_ variety however , towards where Skin - the - Goat , 
 _alias_ the keeper , not turning a hair , was drawing spurts of liquid 
 from his boiler affair . <end>   4.028885399910075

 he was personally concerned , was just pondering in pensive mood . <end>   6.430036404536137
<start> <start> He 
 vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well 
 as yesterday , roughly some score of years previously in the days of the 
 land troubles , when it took the civilised world by storm , figuratively 
 speaking , early in the eighties , eightyone to be correct , when he was 
 just turned fifteen . <end>   4.386370392122477

<start> <start> Mr Bloom inquired . <end>   9.284201040499516
<start> <start> The sailor grimaced , chewing , in a way that might be read as yes , ay or 
 no . <end>   5.475694970833048
<start> <start> Ah , you ve touched there too , Mr Bloom said , Europa point , thinking he 
 had , in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences 
 but he failed to do so , simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the 
 sawdust , and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn . <end>   5.421208385971892
<start> <start> What year would that be about ? <end>   5.649605174640818
<start> <start> Mr B interrogated . <end>   11.41693544115188
<start> <start> Can you recall the 
 boats ? <end>   8.780583326545603
<start> <start> Our _soi - disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before 
 answering : 
 
 I m tired of all them rocks in the sea , he said , and boats and ships . <end>   4.1731524731525615
<start> <start> Salt junk all the time . <end>   6.806036815297586
<start> <start> Tired seemingly , he ceased . <end>   12.488893319414336
<start> <start> His questioner perceiving that he was not 
 likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer , 
 fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the 
 globe , suffice it to say that , as a casual glance at the map revealed , 
 it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly 
 what it meant to rule the waves . <end>   5.889274258573988
<start> <start> On more than one occasion , a dozen at 
 the lowest , near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a 
 superannuated old salt , evidently derelict , seated habitually near the 
 not particularly redolent sea on the wall , staring quite obliviously at 
 it and it at him , dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone 
 somewhere sings . <end>   4.92447804870559
<start> <start> And it left him wondering why . <end>   3.738421486399296
<start> <start> Possibly he had tried 
 to find out the secret for himself , floundering up and down the 
 antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under , well , not 
 exactly under , tempting the fates . <end>   6.041590059614486
<start> <start> And the odds were twenty to nil 
 there was really no secret about it at all . <end>   4.067223057234247
<start> <start> Nevertheless , without going 
 into the _minutiae_ of the business , the eloquent fact remained that 
 the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things 
 somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence 
 though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that 
 sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery 
 and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for 
 that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable 
 institution to which the public at large , no matter where living inland 
 or seaside , as the case might be , having it brought home to them like 
 that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and 
 coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid 
 the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that 
 every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the 
 wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights , Kish and others , liable to 
 capsize at any moment , rounding which he once with his daughter had 
 experienced some remarkably choppy , not to say stormy , weather . <end>   4.4191559106549025
<start> <start> There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_ , the old seadog , 
 himself a rover , proceeded , went ashore and took up a soft job as 
 gentleman s valet at six quid a month . <end>   5.229106832275472
<start> <start> Them are his trousers I ve on me 
 and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife . <end>   8.126737541940038
<start> <start> I m game for that job , 
 shaving and brushup . <end>   6.376022168447381
<start> <start> I hate roaming about . <end>   8.163705708597757
<start> <start> There s my son now , Danny , 
 run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper s in Cork where 
 he could be drawing easy money . <end>   6.009278737239025
<start> <start> What age is he ? <end>   6.690312291638832
<start> <start> queried one hearer who , by the way , seen from the 
 side , bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell , the townclerk , away 
 from the carking cares of office , unwashed of course and in a seedy 
 getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage . <end>   4.370001053877334
<start> <start> Why , the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance , my son , Danny ? <end>   5.618161761996713
<start> <start> He d be about eighteen now , way I figure it . <end>   4.240832362956076
<start> <start> The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow 
 shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was 
 to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent 
 an anchor . <end>   3.212136263937636
<start> <start> There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater , he remarked , sure as nuts . <end>   4.5112675473494095
<start> <start> I must get a wash tomorrow or next day . <end>   3.884716542353305
<start> <start> It s them black lads I objects 
 to . <end>   3.6146296549174854
<start> <start> Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged 
 his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the 
 mariner s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure <NUM> and a 
 young man s sideface looking frowningly rather . <end>   5.380542879858293
<start> <start> That was done when we were lying 
 becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton . <end>   3.449317328814502
<start> <start> Fellow , the 
 name of Antonio , done that . <end>   8.037871626065755
<start> <start> There he is himself , a Greek . <end>   10.781423615759609
<start> <start> Did it hurt much doing it ? <end>   4.197497639887748
<start> <start> one asked the sailor . <end>   9.96111336047422
<start> <start> That worthy , however , was busily engaged in collecting round the . <end>   5.050060661699358
<start> <start> Someway in his . <end>   27.785986812710316
<start> <start> Squeezing or . <end>   14.541640879995175
<start> <start> See here , he said , showing Antonio . <end>   9.83525104230886
<start> <start> And 
 there he is now , he added , the same fellow , pulling the skin with his 
 fingers , some special knack evidently , and he laughing at a yarn . <end>   7.72345933401009
<start> <start> And in point of fact the young man named Antonio s livid face did 
 actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the 
 unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin - the - Goat , who this 
 time stretched over . <end>   3.3229681048313506
<start> <start> Ay , ay , sighed the sailor , looking down on his manly chest . <end>   4.477243490323363
<start> <start> He s gone 
 too . <end>   5.711796346893871
<start> <start> Ate by sharks after . <end>   5.603694261385779
<start> <start> Ay , ay . <end>   6.547948923338352
<start> <start> He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression 
 of before . <end>   5.264724965555075
<start> <start> Neat bit of work , one longshoreman said . <end>   8.311251185038836
<start> <start> And what s the number for ? <end>   9.288844122918452
<start> <start> loafer number two queried . <end>   5.957658565227533
<start> <start> Eaten alive ? <end>   12.775415481877882
<start> <start> a third asked the sailor . <end>   7.925804734208704
<start> <start> Ay , ay , sighed again the latter personage , more cheerily this time 
 with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the 
 direction of the questioner about the number . <end>   5.177728136340518
<start> <start> Ate . <end>   31.40138937508791
<start> <start> A Greek he was . <end>   9.721663475391649
<start> <start> And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his 
 alleged end : 
 
 As bad as old Antonio , 
 For he left me on my ownio . <end>   4.284122842909377
<start> <start> The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat 
 peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on 
 her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill . <end>   4.747033351525326
<start> <start> Mr Bloom , 
 scarcely knowing which way to look , turned away on the moment 
 flusterfied but outwardly calm , and , picking up from the table the pink 
 sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey , if such he was , had 
 laid aside , he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though 
 why pink . <end>   6.8741215529035395
<start> <start> His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round 
 the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that 
 afternoon on Ormond quay , the partially idiotic female , namely , of the 
 lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you ( Mrs B . ) 
 and begged the chance of his washing . <end>   5.6215458311264745
<start> <start> Also why washing which seemed 
 rather vague than not , your washing . <end>   3.5353879490178497
<start> <start> Still candour compelled him to 
 admit he had washed his wife s undergarments when soiled in Holles 
 street and women would and did too a man s similar garments initialled 
 with Bewley and Draper s marking ink ( hers were , that is ) if they 
 really loved him , that is to say , love me , love my dirty shirt . <end>   4.133486389145973
<start> <start> Still 
 just then , being on tenterhooks , he desired the female s room more than 
 her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a 
 rude sign to take herself off . <end>   5.828027387043101
<start> <start> Round the side of the _Evening 
 Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side 
 of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was 
 not exactly all there , viewing with evident amusement the group of 
 gazers round skipper Murphy s nautical chest and then there was no more 
 of her . <end>   4.664737161225616
<start> <start> The gunboat , the keeper said . <end>   9.467281238382823
<start> <start> It beats me , Mr Bloom confided to Stephen , medically I am speaking , 
 how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with 
 disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober 
 senses , if he values his health in the least . <end>   4.9478751041878155
<start> <start> Unfortunate creature ! <end>   13.265134203645303
<start> <start> Of 
 course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition . <end>   5.502704411857928
<start> <start> Still no matter what the cause is from . . . <end>   6.156702643407411
<start> <start> Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders , merely 
 remarking : 
 
 In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a 
 roaring trade . <end>   4.291071674591178
<start> <start> Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to 
 buy the soul . <end>   4.553763270327306
<start> <start> She is a bad merchant . <end>   9.213539850747305
<start> <start> She buys dear and sells cheap . <end>   3.9480665132840196
<start> <start> The elder man , though not by any manner of means an old maid or a 
 prude , said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be 
 put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp ( quite apart 
 from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject ) , a necessary evil , 
 were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities , a 
 thing , he could truthfully state , he , as a _paterfamilias_ , was a 
 stalwart advocate of from the very first start . <end>   5.650099640558714
<start> <start> Whoever embarked on a 
 policy of the sort , he said , and ventilated the matter thoroughly would 
 confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned . <end>   4.926636303088721
<start> <start> You as a good catholic , he observed , talking of body and soul , believe 
 in the soul . <end>   8.934861947829873
<start> <start> Or do you mean the intelligence , the brainpower as such , 
 as distinct from any outside object , the table , let us say , that cup . <end>   7.007324044249245
<start> <start> I 
 believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men 
 as the convolutions of the grey matter . <end>   7.100164643510725
<start> <start> Otherwise we would never have 
 such inventions as X rays , for instance . <end>   3.866552019289194
<start> <start> Do you ? <end>   13.444196166086565
<start> <start> Thus cornered , Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try 
 and concentrate and remember before he could say : 
 
 They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and 
 therefore incorruptible . <end>   6.477748666468538
<start> <start> It would be immortal , I understand , but for 
 the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who , from all I 
 can hear , is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other 
 practical jokes , _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both 
 being excluded by court etiquette . <end>   4.316113823019449
<start> <start> Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the 
 mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he 
 felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple , promptly 
 rejoining : 
 
 Simple ? <end>   5.181705749182762
<start> <start> I shouldn t think that is the proper word . <end>   8.729695260384448
<start> <start> Of course , I grant 
 you , to concede a point , you do knock across a simple soul once in a 
 blue moon . <end>   6.319564105021971
<start> <start> O that , Stephen expostulated , has been proved conclusively by several 
 of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ , apart from circumstantial 
 evidence . <end>   3.849901459608668
<start> <start> On this knotty point however the views of the pair , poles apart as they 
 were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference 
 in their respective ages , clashed . <end>   3.98534025486488
<start> <start> Has been ? <end>   12.311648523121127
<start> <start> the more experienced of the two objected , sticking to his 
 original point with a smile of unbelief . <end>   6.34296078192285
<start> <start> I m not so sure about that . <end>   5.2202659423364155
<start> <start> That s a matter for everyman s opinion and , without dragging in the 
 sectarian side of the business , I beg to differ with you _in toto_ 
 there . <end>   5.329581650063637
<start> <start> My belief is , to tell you the candid truth , that those bits were 
 genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it s the 
 big question of our national poet over again , who precisely wrote them

<start> <start> Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir

<start> <start> Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated 
 article , a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly 
 Roman or antique about it to the lay eye , observing that the point was 
 the least conspicuous point about it . <end>   3.6065649638534762

<start> <start> Look at him . <end>   7.738208794836351
<start> <start> Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was 
 full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it 
 was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire 
 fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent 
 probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly 
 accurate gospel . <end>   4.033627215729453
<start> <start> He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and 
 Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him . <end>   5.7267441708484
<start> <start> Though a 
 wellpreserved man of no little stamina , if a trifle prone to baldness , 
 there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a 
 jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to 
 associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill 
 fraternity . <end>   4.339908344631748
<start> <start> He might even have done for his man supposing it was his 
 own case he told , as people often did about others , namely , that he 
 killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in 
 durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage ( no relation to 
 the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our 
 national poet ) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above 
 described . <end>   3.7902668220413807
<start> <start> On the other hand he might be only bluffing , a pardonable 
 weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs , Dublin residents , like 
 those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner 
 who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner 
 _Hesperus_ and etcetera . <end>   2.9330507653770312

 Aztecs , as they are called , sitting bowlegged , they couldn t straighten 
 their legs if you paid them because the muscles here , you see , he 
 proceeded , indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews 
 or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee , were utterly 
 powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up , being adored as 
 gods . <end>   4.098213676320636
<start> <start> However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures ( who 
 reminded him a bit of Ludwig , _alias_ Ledwidge , when he occupied the 
 boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the 
 management in the _Flying Dutchman_ , a stupendous success , and his host 
 of admirers came in large numbers , everyone simply flocking to hear him 
 though ships of any sort , phantom or the reverse , on the stage usually 
 fell a bit flat as also did trains ) there was nothing intrinsically 
 incompatible about it , he conceded . <end>   4.409912616844112
<start> <start> On the contrary that stab in the 
 back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he 
 was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the 
 fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in 
 little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking 
 fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless 
 necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to 
 have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or 
 her next day on the quiet and , he added , on the cheap . <end>   3.7511855125478473
<start> <start> Spaniards , for instance , he continued , passionate temperaments like

 enhances a woman s natural beauty , no matter what you say . <end>   4.355614681064927
<start> <start> Rumpled 
 stockings , it may be , possibly is , a foible of mine but still it s a

<start> <start> Interest , however , was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the 
 others got on to talking about accidents at sea , ships lost in a fog , 
 collisions with icebergs , all that sort of thing . <end>   5.30710074362378

 had his own say to say . <end>   10.816569384379505

 or words to that effect , a pious medal he had that saved him . <end>   6.249463570361781
<start> <start> So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt s rock , wreck 
 of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for 
 the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry 
 Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand . <end>   4.007220664993218

 to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat . <end>   4.7035526324435075
<start> <start> Let me cross your bows mate , he said to his neighbour who was just 
 gently dropping off into a peaceful doze . <end>   4.610208571155569
<start> <start> He made tracks heavily , slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door , 
 stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore 
 due left . <end>   6.275392624660959
<start> <start> While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who 
 noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship s 
 rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his 
 burning interior , saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew 
 and , applying its nozzle to his lips , take a good old delectable swig 
 out of it with a gurgling noise . <end>   5.2490185702532886
<start> <start> The irrepressible Bloom , who also had 
 a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the 
 counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared 
 to all intents and purposes , could by straining just perceive him , when 
 duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit , gaping up at the piers and 
 girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was 
 all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved . <end>   4.668483978352904
<start> <start> Some 
 person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by 
 the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a 
 brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor , 
 evidently giving it a wide berth , eased himself closer at hand , the 
 noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the 
 ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank . <end>   4.39205746212675

 up , was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid , now 
 practically on the parish rates , given the temporary job by Pat Tobin 
 in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before 
 shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again 
 in to the arms of Morpheus , a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its 
 most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and 
 familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a 
 cool <NUM> a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass 
 proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of . <end>   3.621112474469364

 end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink 
 without a beggarly stiver . <end>   4.579672638191017
<start> <start> He drank needless to be told and it pointed 
 only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of 
 business if a big if , however he had contrived to cure himself of his 
 particular partiality . <end>   5.742726336984703

 coastwise and foreign as well , which was all part and parcel of the

 private potation and the rest of his exertions . <end>   9.530745284728676

 growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or 
 other in seconds or thirds . <end>   4.301745606110366
<start> <start> Mr Bloom s sharp ears heard him then 
 expectorate the plug probably ( which it was ) , so that he must have 
 lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and 
 making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in 
 question . <end>   5.710929980535021
<start> <start> Anyhow in he rolled after his successful 
 libation - _cum_ - potation , introducing an atmosphere of drink into the

 grind , was airing his grievances in a forcible - feeble philippic anent 
 the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he 
 described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none 
 on the face of God s earth , far and away superior to England , with coal 
 in large quantities , six million pounds worth of pork exported every 
 year , ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained 
 out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through

 few irascible words when it waxed hotter , both , needless to say , 
 appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with 
 interest so long as they didn t indulge in recriminations and come to 
 blows . <end>   4.836887052722688
<start> <start> From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was 
 rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for , 
 pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for , he 
 was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the 
 channel , unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for , 
 rather concealed their strength than the opposite . <end>   4.501440547530031
<start> <start> It was quite on a 
 par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred 
 million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out 
 and if , as time went on , that turned out to be how the cat jumped all 
 he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of 
 contingencies , equally relevant to the issue , might occur ere then it 
 was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both 
 countries even though poles apart . <end>   5.776698101747171
<start> <start> Another little interesting point , 
 the amours of whores and chummies , to put it in common parlance , 
 reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against 
 her , more so , in fact . <end>   4.942513059032543

 them , the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris ,

 soul if anything , the others seeing least of the game . <end>   7.043987877264761
<start> <start> And as for the 
 lessee or keeper , who probably wasn t the other person at all , he ( B . ) 
 couldn t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people 
 like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and 
 refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private 
 life and their felonsetting , there always being the offchance of a 
 Dannyman coming forward and turning queen s evidence or king s now like 
 Denis or Peter Carey , an idea he utterly repudiated . <end>   4.589145218789346

<start> <start> Yet , though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his 
 bosom in any shape or form , he certainly did feel and no denying it 
 ( while inwardly remaining what he was ) a certain kind of admiration for 
 a man who had actually brandished a knife , cold steel , with the courage 
 of his political convictions ( though , personally , he would never be a 
 party to any such thing ) , off the same bat as those love vendettas of 
 the south , have her or swing for her , when the husband frequently , 
 after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with 
 the other lucky mortal ( he having had the pair watched ) , inflicted 
 fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative 
 postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her , until it just 
 struck him that Fitz , nicknamed Skin - the - Goat , merely drove the car for 
 the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not , if he was 
 reliably informed , actually party to the ambush which , in point of 
 fact , was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on . <end>   4.386866646320123
<start> <start> In any case 
 that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend , the pseudo 
 Skin - the - etcetera , he had transparently outlived his welcome . <end>   5.124898921849766

 silenced the offender . <end>   5.227202268473877

<start> <start> He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride

 very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of 
 everything , greed and jealousy , people never knowing when to stop . <end>   4.1961964140475505

<start> <start> He could hear , of course , all kinds of words changing colour like those

<start> <start> What ? <end>   7.275240556106635
<start> <start> You both belong to Ireland , the brain and the brawn . <end>   11.298017649688404
<start> <start> Each is equally important . <end>   5.394816850647762
<start> <start> You suspect , Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh , that I may 
 be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called 
 Ireland for short . <end>   5.736464548298539
<start> <start> I would go a step farther , Mr Bloom insinuated . <end>   6.238117890826821
<start> <start> But I suspect , Stephen interrupted , that Ireland must be important 
 because it belongs to me . <end>   4.920616045426893
<start> <start> What belongs , queried Mr Bloom bending , fancying he was perhaps under 
 some misapprehension . <end>   4.904934394060982
<start> <start> Excuse me . <end>   10.654941679813149
<start> <start> What was it you . . . ? <end>   10.03281266914598
<start> <start> Stephen , patently crosstempered , repeated and shoved aside his mug of 
 coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely , adding : 
 
 We can t change the country . <end>   3.6058237985742565
<start> <start> Let us change the subject . <end>   5.621365819535331
<start> <start> At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom , to change the subject , looked 
 down but in a quandary , as he couldn t tell exactly what construction 
 to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry . <end>   4.781071091147493

 kind was clearer than the other part . <end>   5.247594072246382

 foreign to his sober state . <end>   4.62978667337496

 attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he 
 hadn t been familiarised with the right sort of people . <end>   4.543385205145529
<start> <start> With a touch of 
 fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an 
 air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris , 
 the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister , 
 failing to throw much light on the subject , however , he brought to mind 
 instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in 
 the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves . <end>   4.289453631381804
<start> <start> For 
 instance there was the case of O Callaghan , for one , the halfcrazy 
 faddist , respectably connected though of inadequate means , with his mad 
 vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a 
 nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously 
 sporting in public a suit of brown paper ( a fact ) . <end>   3.4768248095576806
<start> <start> And then the usual 
 _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed 
 into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends , after a 
 strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard , so 
 as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law 
 amendment act , certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not 
 divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains . <end>   3.518047653652194

 then heir apparent , the other members of the upper ten and other high 
 personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state , 
 he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running 
 counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before 
 under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature , a thing good 
 Mrs Grundy , as the law stands , was terribly down on though not for the 
 reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women 
 chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being 
 largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it . <end>   4.5549706812681805

 was twenty odd years . <end>   4.717469987226526

<start> <start> Something evidently riled them in 
 his death . <end>   8.212886095303983
<start> <start> Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just 
 when his various different political arrangements were nearing 
 completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having 
 neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold 
 resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his 
 room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a 
 fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find 
 the job was taken out of their hands . <end>   3.111356373201556

 the bounds of possibility . <end>   3.585567699145692

 feet , whereas Messrs So and So who , though they weren t even a patch on

 auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_ 
 or was it _United Ireland_ , a privilege he keenly appreciated , and , in 
 point of fact , handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he 
 said _Thank you_ , excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid 
 exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the

<start> <start> And then , number one , you came up against the man in 
 possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the 
 Tichborne case , Roger Charles Tichborne , _Bella_ was the boat s name to 
 the best of his recollection he , the heir , went down in as the evidence 
 went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink , lord Bellew 
 was it , as he might very easily have picked up the details from some 
 pal on board ship and then , when got up to tally with the description 
 given , introduce himself with : _Excuse me , my name is So and So_ or 
 some such commonplace remark . <end>   5.348432752885808

<start> <start> This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair 
 amount of laughter among his _entourage_ . <end>   3.581017171172743
<start> <start> As regards Bloom he , without 
 the faintest suspicion of a smile , merely gazed in the direction of the 
 door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused 
 extraordinary interest at the time when the facts , to make matters 
 worse , were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed 
 between them full of sweet nothings . <end>   5.232975485410145
<start> <start> First it was strictly Platonic 
 till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till 
 bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of 
 the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not 
 a few evildisposed , however , who were resolved upon encompassing his 
 downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to 
 anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed 
 into . <end>   4.33257972787799
<start> <start> Since their names were coupled , though , since he was her declared 
 favourite , where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the 
 rank and file from the housetops , the fact , namely , that he had shared 
 her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went 
 through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape 
 of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a 
 particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment 
 with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel , having gained 
 admittance in the same fashion , a fact the weeklies , addicted to the 
 lubric a little , simply coined shoals of money out of . <end>   4.868241297938722
<start> <start> Whereas the 
 simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not 
 being up to the scratch , with nothing in common between them beyond the 
 name , and then a real man arriving on the scene , strong to the verge of 
 weakness , falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home 
 ties , the usual sequel , to bask in the loved one s smiles . <end>   7.002599458883145

 absolutely if he regarded her with affection , carried away by a wave of 
 folly . <end>   4.5998949061909
<start> <start> A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented 
 obviously by gifts of a high order , as compared with the other military 
 supernumerary that is ( who was just the usual everyday _farewell , my 
 gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons , the 18th 
 hussars to be accurate ) and inflammable doubtless ( the fallen leader , 
 that is , not the other ) in his own peculiar way which she of course , 
 woman , quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame 
 which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the 
 gospel as a whole , his erstwhile staunch adherents , and his beloved 
 evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts 
 of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that 
 exceeded their most sanguine expectations , very effectually cooked his 
 matrimonial goose , thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in 
 the same way as the fabled ass s kick . <end>   4.768240670625871

<start> <start> North or south , 
 however , it was just the wellknown case of hot passion , pure and 
 simple , upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the 
 very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so , types that 
 wouldn t do things by halves , passionate abandon of the south , casting 
 every shred of decency to the winds . <end>   4.661157060136959

 rapidly finally he . <end>   5.974929235375013
<start> <start> Stephen , obviously addressed , looked down on the photo showing a large 
 sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she 
 was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously 
 low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom , with more than 
 vision of breasts , her full lips parted and some perfect teeth , 
 standing near , ostensibly with gravity , a piano on the rest of which 
 was _In Old Madrid_ , a ballad , pretty in its way , which was then all 
 the vogue . <end>   4.91377589713171
<start> <start> Her ( the lady s ) eyes , dark , large , looked at Stephen , about

 street , Dublin s premier photographic artist , being responsible for the 
 esthetic execution . <end>   5.306832819788106

 her then . <end>   11.759751529807243
<start> <start> Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his 
 legal wife who , he intimated , was the accomplished daughter of Major 
 Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a 
 singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered 
 barely sweet sixteen . <end>   3.8785507464966535
<start> <start> As for the face it was a speaking likeness in 
 expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a 
 lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage 
 in that getup . <end>   6.38999482878852
<start> <start> She could without difficulty , he said , have posed for 
 the ensemble , not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the . <end>   5.583963470530919
<start> <start> He dwelt , 
 being a bit of an artist in his spare time , on the female form in 
 general developmentally because , as it so happened , no later than that 
 afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues , perfectly developed as 
 works of art , in the National Museum . <end>   6.320412537195755
<start> <start> Marble could give the original , 
 shoulders , back , all the symmetry , all the rest . <end>   10.421536492216616

<start> <start> Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn t art in a 
 word . <end>   5.485834880581161
<start> <start> The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar s 
 good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to 
 speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the 
 beauty for himself , her stage presence being , frankly , a treat in 
 itself which the camera could not at all do justice to . <end>   4.703281888921752
<start> <start> But it was 
 scarcely professional etiquette so . <end>   5.741849498295254
<start> <start> Though it was a warm pleasant sort 
 of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering , for 
 sunshine after storm . <end>   4.756442265200394
<start> <start> And he did feel a kind of need there and then to 
 follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by 
 moving a motion . <end>   4.829702953943087
<start> <start> Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly 
 soiled photo creased by opulent curves , none the worse for wear 
 however , and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further 
 increasing the other s possible embarrassment while gauging her 
 symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_ . <end>   2.8111554006946893
<start> <start> In fact the slight soiling was only 
 an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled , good as new , 
 much better in fact with the starch out . <end>   4.843716196161692
<start> <start> Suppose she was gone when he ? <end>   12.614077617678122
<start> <start> I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely 
 as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning 
 littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses 
 ( _sic_ ) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately 
 beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray . <end>   3.809707311162478

 _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain , far and away the pick of 
 the bunch though you wouldn t think he had it in him yet you would . <end>   5.69874841583726
<start> <start> Besides he said the picture was handsome which , say what you like , it 
 was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter . <end>   7.166432986978086
<start> <start> And why not ? <end>   10.028463575293737
<start> <start> How they were fated to meet and an attachment 
 sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the 
 public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy 
 and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they 
 openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside 
 hotel and relations , when the thing ran its normal course , became in 
 due course intimate . <end>   3.3255577501514595
<start> <start> Then the decree _nisi_ and the King s proctor 
 tries to show cause why and , he failing to quash it , _nisi_ was made 
 absolute . <end>   4.332638488218755
<start> <start> But as for that the two misdemeanants , wrapped up as they 
 largely were in one another , could safely afford to ignore it as they 
 very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor 
 who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course . <end>   4.864639157323515
<start> <start> Though palpably a radically altered man he 
 was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with 
 that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the 
 shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that 
 their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which 
 she , however , was the first to perceive . <end>   3.9019500899009127
<start> <start> As those were particularly hot 
 times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a 
 nasty prod of some chap s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated 
 lodging some place about the pit of the stomach , fortunately not of a 
 grave character . <end>   4.324417584597781
<start> <start> His hat ( Parnell s ) a silk one was inadvertently 
 knocked off and , as a matter of strict history , Bloom was the man who 
 picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to 
 return it to him ( and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity ) 
 who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat 
 at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the 
 country he , as a matter of fact , having gone into it more for the kudos 
 of the thing than anything else , what s bred in the bone instilled into 
 him in infancy at his mother s knee in the shape of knowing what good 
 form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and 
 thanked him with perfect _aplomb_ , saying : _Thank you , sir_ , though in 
 a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal 
 profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the 
 course of the day , history repeating itself with a difference , after 
 the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory 
 after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave . <end>   5.24085086007274
<start> <start> On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes 
 of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest , laughing 
 immoderately , pretending to understand everything , the why and the 
 wherefore , and in reality not knowing their own minds , it being a case 
 for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate 
 husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter 
 from the usual boy Jones , who happened to come across them at the 
 crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another s arms , 
 drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a 
 domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord 
 and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not 
 receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would 
 overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes 
 though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as 
 quite possibly there were several others . <end>   4.124153965842434
<start> <start> He personally , being of a 
 sceptical bias , believed and didn t make the smallest bones about 
 saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging 
 around on the waiting list about a lady , even supposing she was the 
 best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the 
 sake of argument , when , neglecting her duties , she chose to be tired of 
 wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to 
 press their attentions on her with improper intent , the upshot being 
 that her affections centred on another , the cause of many _liaisons_ 
 between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty 
 and younger men , no doubt as several famous cases of feminine 
 infatuation proved up to the hilt . <end>   4.372097840410691
<start> <start> It was a thousand pities a young fellow , blessed with an allowance of 
 brains as his neighbour obviously was , should waste his valuable time 
 with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last 
 him his lifetime . <end>   4.21402566349479
<start> <start> In the nature of single blessedness he would one day 
 take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the 
 interim ladies society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the 
 gravest possible doubts , not that he wanted in the smallest to pump 
 Stephen about Miss Ferguson ( who was very possibly the particular 
 lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning ) , as 
 to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl 
 courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to 
 their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of 
 complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ways and 
 flowers and chocs . <end>   4.501260736302594
<start> <start> To think of him house and homeless , rooked by some 
 landlady worse than any stepmother , was really too bad at his age . <end>   4.1803784068044605
<start> <start> The 
 queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who 
 was several years the other s senior or like his father but something 
 substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made

 Dumpty boiled . <end>   3.172812735689942
<start> <start> At what o clock did you dine ? <end>   5.732713507589018
<start> <start> he questioned of the slim form and tired 
 though unwrinkled face . <end>   5.564019849085186
<start> <start> Some time yesterday , Stephen said . <end>   4.331116230390911
<start> <start> Yesterday ! <end>   35.49369557982899
<start> <start> exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow 
 Friday . <end>   6.004658172548894
<start> <start> Ah , you mean it s after twelve ! <end>   8.87908130944092
<start> <start> The day before yesterday , Stephen said , improving on himself . <end>   4.4148142532779415
<start> <start> Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected . <end>   4.254011138814658
<start> <start> At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some 
 score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to 
 parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in 
 retrospect ( which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself ) he had a 
 sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas . <end>   3.720371536145464
<start> <start> For instance when the 
 evicted tenants question , then at its first inception , bulked largely 
 in people s mind though , it goes without saying , not contributing a 
 copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums , some of which 
 wouldn t exactly hold water , he at the outset in principle at all 
 events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the 
 trend of modern opinion ( a partiality , however , which , realising his 
 mistake , he was subsequently partially cured of ) and even was twitted 
 with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he 
 at one time inculcated as a backtothelander , which was one reason he 
 strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion 
 by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan s so that 
 he , though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of 
 mortals , be it repeated , departed from his customary habit to give him 
 ( metaphorically ) one in the gizzard though , so far as politics 
 themselves were concerned , he was only too conscious of the casualties 
 invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity 
 and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on 
 fine young fellows , chiefly , destruction of the fittest , in a word . <end>   4.306233149759969
<start> <start> Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons , getting on for one , as it 
 was , it was high time to be retiring for the night . <end>   6.548300475444825
<start> <start> The crux was it was 
 a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue 
 ( somebody having a temper of her own sometimes ) and spoil the hash 
 altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog ( breed 
 unknown ) with a lame paw ( not that the cases were either identical or 
 the reverse though he had hurt his hand too ) to Ontario Terrace as he 
 very distinctly remembered , having been there , so to speak . <end>   4.054810761946048
<start> <start> On the 
 other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount 
 or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which 
 of the two alternatives . <end>   6.825409854087976
<start> <start> Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved 
 him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity , all things 
 considered . <end>   8.176951793922642
<start> <start> His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or 
 not over effusive but it grew on him someway . <end>   5.4177212171964735
<start> <start> For one thing he mightn t 
 what you call jump at the idea , if approached , and what mostly worried 
 him was he didn t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly , 
 supposing he did entertain the proposal , as it would afford him very 
 great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in 
 his way or some wardrobe , if found suitable . <end>   5.511352623052831
<start> <start> At all events he wound up 
 by concluding , eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent , a cup of 
 Epps s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two 
 and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands 
 and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast 
 amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort 
 was kicked up . <end>   4.745728304757817
<start> <start> A move had to be made because that merry old soul , the 
 grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot , didn t 
 appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly 
 beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger s bawdyhouse 
 of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would 
 be the best clue to that equivocal character s whereabouts for a few 
 days to come , alternately racking their feelings ( the mermaids ) with 
 sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to 
 freeze the marrow of anybody s bones and mauling their largesized 
 charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment 
 of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for 
 as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address , as 
 Mr Algebra remarks _passim_ . <end>   3.5371507892809184
<start> <start> At the same time he inwardly chuckled over 
 his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being 
 a jew . <end>   4.948803200576162
<start> <start> People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what 
 properly riled them was a bite from a sheep . <end>   5.023309752204798
<start> <start> The most vulnerable point 
 too of tender Achilles . <end>   4.1653589147132095
<start> <start> Your god was a jew . <end>   7.2521079862810325
<start> <start> Because mostly they 
 appeared to imagine he came from Carrick - on - Shannon or somewhereabouts 
 in the county Sligo . <end>   4.132034828123517
<start> <start> I propose , our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while 
 prudently pocketing her photo , as it s rather stuffy here you just come 
 home with me and talk things over . <end>   3.2226526670648603
<start> <start> My diggings are quite close in the 
 vicinity . <end>   6.219874548915355
<start> <start> You can t drink that stuff . <end>   5.299460475228181
<start> <start> Do you like cocoa ? <end>   10.528514592961852
<start> <start> Wait . <end>   9.197181752885049
<start> <start> I ll 
 just pay this lot . <end>   4.4429801523254975
<start> <start> The best plan clearly being to clear out , the remainder being plain 
 sailing , he beckoned , while prudently pocketing the photo , to the 
 keeper of the shanty who didn t seem to . <end>   4.832779769460801
<start> <start> Yes , that s the best , he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of 
 that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less . <end>   4.870199855444889
<start> <start> All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his ( B s ) busy brain , 
 education ( the genuine article ) , literature , journalism , prize titbits , 
 up to date billing , concert tours in English watering resorts packed 
 with hydros and seaside theatres , turning money away , duets in Italian 
 with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other 
 things , no necessity , of course , to tell the world and his wife from 
 the housetops about it , and a slice of luck . <end>   4.4773261530198525
<start> <start> An opening was all was 
 wanted . <end>   10.85788982538557
<start> <start> Because he more than suspected he had his father s voice to 
 bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be 
 just as well , by the way no harm , to trail the conversation in the 
 direction of that particular red herring just to . <end>   6.2651864602683665
<start> <start> The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former 
 viceroy , earl Cadogan , had presided at the cabdrivers association 
 dinner in London somewhere . <end>   5.360117330631665
<start> <start> Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this 
 thrilling announcement . <end>   6.233411601731803
<start> <start> Then the old specimen in the corner who 
 appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony 
 MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary s lodge or words to 
 that effect . <end>   4.415015477143188
<start> <start> To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered 
 why . <end>   3.422940541910381
<start> <start> Give us a squint at that literature , grandfather , the ancient mariner 
 put in , manifesting some natural impatience . <end>   4.136467951189583
<start> <start> And welcome , answered the elderly party thus addressed . <end>   3.152361971065347
<start> <start> The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles 
 which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears . <end>   4.591724382944365
<start> <start> Are you bad in the eyes ? <end>   12.02141521198207
<start> <start> the sympathetic personage like the townclerk 
 queried . <end>   4.665675421460226
<start> <start> Why , answered the seafarer with the tartan beard , who seemingly was a 
 bit of a literary cove in his own small way , staring out of seagreen 
 portholes as you might well describe them as , I uses goggles reading . <end>   4.971305057855094
<start> <start> Sand in the Red Sea done that . <end>   7.4623630978866045
<start> <start> One time I could read a book in the 
 dark , manner of speaking . <end>   7.648925989839347
<start> <start> _The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my 
 favourite and _Red as a Rose is She . _ 
 
 Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what , 
 found drowned or the exploits of King Willow , Iremonger having made a 
 hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts , during which 
 time ( completely regardless of Ire ) the keeper was intensely occupied 
 loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched 
 him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it , all of them who were 
 sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions , 
 that is to say , either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial 
 remark . <end>   2.9840807505530114
<start> <start> To cut a long story short Bloom , grasping the situation , was the first 
 to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first 
 and foremost , being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for 
 the occasion , taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine 
 host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were 
 not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming , making a 
 grand total of fourpence ( the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four 
 coppers , literally the last of the Mohicans ) , he having previously 
 spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him 
 in unmistakable figures , coffee 2d , confectionery do , and honestly well 
 worth twice the money once in a way , as Wetherup used to remark . <end>   4.134876028676926
<start> <start> Come , he counselled to close the _séance_ . <end>   5.727000193652542
<start> <start> Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the 
 shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and 
 company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their 
 _dolce far niente_ . <end>   4.2134867363568285
<start> <start> Stephen , who confessed to still feeling poorly and 
 fagged out , paused at the , for a moment , the door . <end>   7.496818956111
<start> <start> One thing I never understood , he said to be original on the spur of 
 the moment . <end>   9.099733921975979
<start> <start> Why they put tables upside down at night , I mean chairs 
 upside down , on the tables in cafés . <end>   5.264888332374293
<start> <start> To which impromptu the 
 neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment s hesitation , saying 
 straight off : 
 
 To sweep the floor in the morning . <end>   4.676725863378011
<start> <start> So saying he skipped around , nimbly considering , frankly at the same 
 time apologetic to get on his companion s right , a habit of his , by the 
 bye , his right side being , in classical idiom , his tender Achilles . <end>   5.6598957116334985
<start> <start> The 
 night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit 
 weak on his pins . <end>   3.7210537734108873
<start> <start> It will ( the air ) do you good , Bloom said , meaning also the walk , in a 
 moment . <end>   7.667015849895579
<start> <start> Come . <end>   12.826001853428986
<start> <start> It s not far . <end>   8.02682458323933
<start> <start> Lean on me . <end>   10.716416382099688
<start> <start> Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen s right and led him on 
 accordingly . <end>   8.472914517613829
<start> <start> Yes , Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange 
 kind of flesh of a different man approach him , sinewless and wobbly and 
 all that . <end>   6.102410512490291
<start> <start> Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones , brazier etc . <end>   3.8231711786894698
<start> <start> where the 
 municipal supernumerary , ex Gumley , was still to all intents and 
 purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy , as the adage has it , dreaming 
 of fresh fields and pastures new . <end>   5.509317948076894
<start> <start> And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the 
 analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the 
 part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the 
 time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class , probably the 
 selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings . <end>   5.057962365873229
<start> <start> So they turned on to chatting about music , a form of art for which 
 Bloom , as a pure amateur , possessed the greatest love , as they made 
 tracks arm in arm across Beresford place . <end>   5.673997594055014
<start> <start> Wagnerian music , though 
 confessedly grand in its way , was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to 
 follow at the first go - off but the music of Mercadante s _Huguenots_ , 
 Meyerbeer s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart s _Twelfth Mass_ 
 he simply revelled in , the _Gloria_ in that being , to his mind , the 
 acme of first class music as such , literally knocking everything else 
 into a cocked hat . <end>   4.794204282331684
<start> <start> He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the 
 catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line 
 such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live 
 thy protestant to be_ . <end>   3.422692519370542
<start> <start> He also yielded to none in his admiration of 
 Rossini s _Stabat Mater_ , a work simply abounding in immortal numbers , 
 in which his wife , Madam Marion Tweedy , made a hit , a veritable 
 sensation , he might safely say , greatly adding to her other laurels and 
 putting the others totally in the shade , in the jesuit fathers church 
 in upper Gardiner street , the sacred edifice being thronged to the 
 doors to hear her with virtuosos , or _virtuosi_ rather . <end>   5.447840797440751
<start> <start> There was the 
 unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it 
 to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was 
 a generally voiced desire for an encore . <end>   6.295515247379436
<start> <start> On the whole though favouring 
 preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_ , 
 a gem in its line , he had a _penchant_ , though with only a surface 
 knowledge , for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn . <end>   3.954967840025134
<start> <start> And 
 talking of that , taking it for granted he knew all about the old 
 favourites , he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel s air in _Martha , 
 M appari_ , which , curiously enough , he had heard or overheard , to be 
 more accurate , on yesterday , a privilege he keenly appreciated , from 
 the lips of Stephen s respected father , sung to perfection , a study of 
 the number , in fact , which made all the others take a back seat . <end>   5.64558859578052
<start> <start> Stephen , in reply to a politely put query , said he didn t sing it but 
 launched out into praises of Shakespeare s songs , at least of in or 
 about that period , the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near 
 Gerard the herbalist , who _anno ludendo hausi , Doulandus_ , an 
 instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch , 
 whom B . did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded 
 familiar , for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ 
 and _comes_ conceits and Byrd ( William ) who played the virginals , he 
 said , in the Queen s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one 
 Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull . <end>   3.4209286953891356
<start> <start> On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond 
 the swingchains a horse , dragging a sweeper , paced on the paven ground , 
 brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not 
 perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to 
 sixtyfive guineas and John Bull . <end>   3.8811030164705835
<start> <start> He inquired if it was John Bull the 
 political celebrity of that ilk , as it struck him , the two identical 
 names , as a striking coincidence . <end>   6.224624594166161
<start> <start> By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn , which perceiving , 
 Bloom , who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual , plucked the other s 
 sleeve gently , jocosely remarking : 
 
 Our lives are in peril tonight . <end>   3.667092614158409
<start> <start> Beware of the steamroller . <end>   17.358876552692564
<start> <start> They thereupon stopped . <end>   7.740584353791118
<start> <start> Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth 
 anything like sixtyfive guineas , suddenly in evidence in the dark quite 
 near so that it seemed new , a different grouping of bones and even 
 flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker , a hipshaker , a 
 blackbuttocker , a taildangler , a headhanger putting his hind foot 
 foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch , busy with 
 his thoughts . <end>   4.8922343425978765
<start> <start> But such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn t a lump 
 of sugar but , as he wisely reflected , you could scarcely be prepared 
 for every emergency that might crop up . <end>   5.110747532633625
<start> <start> He was just a big nervous 
 foolish noodly kind of a horse , without a second care in the world . <end>   5.444157520376108
<start> <start> But 
 even a dog , he reflected , take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan s , of the 
 same size , would be a holy horror to face . <end>   5.499232585423417
<start> <start> But it was no animal s fault 
 in particular if he was built that way like the camel , ship of the 
 desert , distilling grapes into potheen in his hump . <end>   5.185185824702209
<start> <start> Nine tenths of them 
 all could be caged or trained , nothing beyond the art of man barring 
 the bees . <end>   5.241197532884907
<start> <start> Whale with a harpoon hairpin , alligator tickle the small of 
 his back and he sees the joke , chalk a circle for a rooster , tiger my 
 eagle eye . <end>   4.030120456235714
<start> <start> These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field 
 occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen s words while the 
 ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly 
 interesting old . <end>   5.620617201127075
<start> <start> What s this I was saying ? <end>   8.88578372643247
<start> <start> Ah , yes ! <end>   9.860257310234374
<start> <start> My wife , he intimated , plunging _in 
 medias res_ , would have the greatest of pleasure in making your 
 acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind . <end>   3.559717378761659
<start> <start> He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen , 
 image of his mother , which was not quite the same as the usual handsome 
 blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after 
 as he was perhaps not that way built . <end>   6.360432716990901
<start> <start> Still , supposing he had his father s gift as he more than suspected , it 
 opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall s Irish 
 industries , concert on the preceding Monday , and aristocracy in 
 general . <end>   5.218550535547782
<start> <start> Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has 
 End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck , a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows 
 come from . <end>   3.2264162954151647
<start> <start> Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_ 
 about the clear sea and the voices of sirens , sweet murderers of men , 
 which boggled Bloom a bit : 
 
 Von der Sirenen Listigkeit 
 Tun die Poeten dichten . <end>   3.443165710535392
<start> <start> These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_ . <end>   3.3531319311648047
<start> <start> Bloom , nodding , 
 said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which 
 he did . <end>   8.280868329171698
<start> <start> A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that , the rarest of boons , 
 which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out , could 
 easily , if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice 
 production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the 
 bargain , command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and 
 procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into 
 fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial 
 magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his 
 university degree of B . A . ( a huge ad in its way ) and gentlemanly 
 bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would 
 infallibly score a distinct success , being blessed with brains which 
 also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites , if his 
 clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into 
 their good graces as he , a youthful tyro in society s sartorial 
 niceties , hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate 
 against you . <end>   3.6510592909085546
<start> <start> It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily 
 foresee him participating in their musical and artistic 
 _conversaziones_ during the festivities of the Christmas season , for 
 choice , causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and 
 being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation , cases of which , as he 
 happened to know , were on record in fact , without giving the show away , 
 he himself once upon a time , if he cared to , could easily have . <end>   5.3568030166354506
<start> <start> Added 
 to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be 
 sneezed at , going hand in hand with his tuition fees . <end>   5.989059534823826
<start> <start> Not , he 
 parenthesised , that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily 
 embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of 
 time . <end>   5.123420286245929
<start> <start> But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and 
 both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity 
 in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a 
 cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped . <end>   4.00951843437191
<start> <start> Besides , though 
 taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree , original music like that , 
 different from the conventional rut , would rapidly have a great vogue 
 as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin s musical world after the 
 usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public 
 by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_ . <end>   3.3404059234057155
<start> <start> Yes , 
 beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and 
 he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high 
 place in the city s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and ,

 criminality , decimating epidemics : catastrophic cataclysms which make

 futures in comparison with which the years , threescore and ten , of 
 allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity . <end>   3.358833748110357

 and mounds , of microbes , germs , bacteria , bacilli , spermatozoa : of the 
 incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible 
 molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single 
 pinhead : of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white 
 bodies , themselves universes of void space constellated with other 
 bodies , each , in continuity , its universe of divisible component bodies

 bodies , dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division

<start> <start> A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite 
 the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack ( an 
 alteration which he had frequently intended to execute ) : the blue and 
 white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the 
 door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa : the walnut sideboard 
 ( a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress ) had 
 been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but 
 more perilous position in front of the door : two chairs had been moved 
 from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally 
 occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table . <end>   4.646143166446596
<start> <start> Describe them . <end>   13.280523662483422
<start> <start> One : a squat stuffed easychair , with stout arms extended and back 
 slanted to the rere , which , repelled in recoil , had then upturned an 
 irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply 
 upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing 
 discolouration . <end>   3.0675824464001336
<start> <start> The other : a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane

<start> <start> With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects ? <end>   3.2646613088162475
<start> <start> With strain , elevating a candlestick : with pain , feeling on his right 
 temple a contused tumescence : with attention , focussing his gaze on a 
 large dull passive and a slender bright active : with solicitation , 
 bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe : with amusement , 
 remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan s scheme of colour containing the 
 gradation of green : with pleasure , repeating the words and antecedent 
 act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the 
 consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual 
 discolouration . <end>   2.8128831009756317
<start> <start> His next proceeding ? <end>   7.648612108201986
<start> <start> From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black 
 diminutive cone , one inch in height , placed it on its circular base on 
 a small tin plate , placed his candlestick on the right corner of the 
 mantelpiece , produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus 
 ( illustrated ) entitled Agendath Netaim , unfolded the same , examined it 
 superficially , rolled it into a thin cylinder , ignited it in the 
 candleflame , applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the 
 latter reached the stage of rutilance , placed the cylinder in the basin 
 of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to 
 facilitate total combustion . <end>   3.8430464116390977

 Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his 
 breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when 
 he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his 
 highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan 
 that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing 
 all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was 
 actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all 
 her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and 
 earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God 
 help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and 
 lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was 
 pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like 
 her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a 
 welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here 
 and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her 
 dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats 
 especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that 
 and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always 
 if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much 
 better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I 
 suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have 
 a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till 
 they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as 
 much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre 
 sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was 
 O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he 
 sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day 
 I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones 
 she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into 
 a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying 
 on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more 
 like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same 
 besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor 
 paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I 
 was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it 
 not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by 
 his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her 
 so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was 
 really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it 
 planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember 
 Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he 
 not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and 
 turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what 
 harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to 
 him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever 
 met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle 
 in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in 
 with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as 
 I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a 
 letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the 
 paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the 
 blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably 
 that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all 
 men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is 
 now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old 
 fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I 
 care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though 
 Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my 
 nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace 
 padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell 
 of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by 
 getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat 
 without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was 
 drinking water <NUM> woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of 
 course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table 
 on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing 
 my potatoes and the oysters <NUM> / <NUM> per doz going out to see her aunt if 
 you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on 
 with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you 
 have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters 
 but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be 
 alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I 
 found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a 
 little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave 
 her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do 
 out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out 
 the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I 
 couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar 
 and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the 
 place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because 
 he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere 
 and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan 
 gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there 
 steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb 
 to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he 
 has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out 
 and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the 
 satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be 
 always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking 
 boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id 
 confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my 
 garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I 
 know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging 
 drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this 
 that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would 
 because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in 
 the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a 
 stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and 
 he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he 
 is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it 
 tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine 
 Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what 
 he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply 
 ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it 
 till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your 
 lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the 
 world about it people make its only the first time after that its just 
 the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man 
 without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when 
 you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish 
 some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in 
 his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul 
 almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to 
 Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and 
 I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my 
 child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where 
 you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done 
 with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put 
 it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he 
 want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat 
 hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he 
 Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in 
 the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never 
 turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost 
 for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them 
 Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense 
 off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre 
 married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the 
 pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt 
 like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though 
 I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of 
 his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it 
 who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of 
 drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they 
 stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking 
 green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with 
 the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American 
 that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do 
 to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took 
 the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt 
 lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I 
 popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful 
 to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when 
 I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in 
 Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and 
 tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing 
 about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that 
 evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it 
 brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to 
 church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only 
 grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I 
 lit the lamp because he must have come <NUM> or <NUM> times with that 
 tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or 
 whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is 
 not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my 
 hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a 
 thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think 
 a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life 
 felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must 
 have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with 
 a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into 
 you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious 
 look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a 
 tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on 
 me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt 
 washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice 
 invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if 
 someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went 
 through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina 
 Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up 
 with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a 
 smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like 
 a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the 
 last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and 
 bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied 
 till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what 
 supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was 
 married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has 
 more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting 
 Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him 
 off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I 
 know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing 
 and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming 
 and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not 
 liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over 
 politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a 
 carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive 
 about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for 
 I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he 
 annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot 
 of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often 
 wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family 
 physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was 
 crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with 
 her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever 
 he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me 
 the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that 
 finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I 
 know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out 
 to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know 
 plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch 
 him with my veil and gloves on going out <NUM> kiss then would send them 
 all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of 
 course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him 
 that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love 
 him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might 
 imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of 
 a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it 
 out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and 
 wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the 
 night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I 
 want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper 
 with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too 
 much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know 
 more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie 
 whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I 
 said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash 
 possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick 
 when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the 
 indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what 
 spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at 
 that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was 
 too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged 
 afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of 
 laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling 
 out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great 
 humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it 
 meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us 
 not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault 
 she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes 
 got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her 
 face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she 
 must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment 
 she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk 
 about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes 
 he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him 
 just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might 
 murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes 
 mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when 
 he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he 
 always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and 
 now hes going about in his slippers to look for <NUM> for a postcard 
 U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff 
 to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what 
 could you make of a man like that Id rather die <NUM> times over than 
 marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like 
 me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and 
 he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick 
 that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man 
 yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and 
 do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating 
 drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask 
 us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because 
 they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off 
 flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say 
 its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have 
 been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being 
 hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do 
 besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they 
 
 theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he 
 noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C 
 with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both 
 ordered <NUM> teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his 
 two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it 
 was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed 
 breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting 
 all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long 
 one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got 
 after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish 
 times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to 
 Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the 
 turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea 
 <NUM> days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him 
 because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he 
 meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that 
 if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill 
 stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still 
 I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of 
 a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to 
 mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my 
 stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another 
 time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I 
 could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world 
 that I what did he say I could give <NUM> points in <NUM> to Katty Lanner and 
 beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because 
 the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in 
 the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere 
 I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell 
 DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on 
 the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting 
 for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown 
 part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was 
 always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his 
 mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a 
 place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him 
 about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there 
 and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it 
 or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an 
 idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got 
 me so cheap as he did he was <NUM> times worse himself anyhow begging me 
 to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming 
 along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had 
 to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape 
 of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me 
 when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject 
 of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced 
 things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels 
 even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one 
 in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see 
 every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain 
 I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the 
 Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the 
 Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking 
 slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they 
 can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on 
 it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were 
 you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me 
 his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it 
 was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he 
 pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he 
 said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an 
 excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time 
 till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his 
 waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in 
 the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them 
 and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the 
 sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet 
 if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you 
 never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it 
 if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers 
 outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him 
 from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he 
 circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do 
 everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting 
 all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the 
 butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me 
 that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to 
 any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we 
 met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw 
 I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was 
 always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky 
 man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake 
 dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it 
 used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in 
 Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children 
 seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice 
 a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman 
 when he sent me the <NUM> big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote 
 the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it 
 simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to 
 embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the 
 same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you 
 think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the 
 door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface 
 Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after 
 dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me 
 professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in 
 his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out 
 you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I 
 thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches 
 first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was 
 trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he 
 must have been a bit late because it was <NUM> / <NUM> after <NUM> when I saw the <NUM> 
 Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch 
 he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after 
 when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty 
 when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even 
 put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week 
 were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers 
 anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms 
 at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new 
 bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next 
 room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the 
 wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all 
 very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we 
 never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes 
 going where he is besides something always happens with him the time 
 going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for 
 the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with 
 the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and 
 the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion 
 for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two 
 gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was 
 too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a 
 good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd 
 have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him 
 O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I 
 wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the 
 train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots 
 of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly 
 be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone 
 in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something 
 about him <NUM> or <NUM> tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the 
 window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what 
 would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last 
 concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall 
 Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen 
 Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my 
 singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts 
 when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him 
 managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to 
 sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead 
 Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out 
 he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some 
 old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein 
 lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and 
 nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very 
 intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats 
 all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I 
 hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and 
 Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd 
 East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and 
 just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was 
 lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty 
 he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the 
 road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could 
 have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of 
 the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of 
 dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their 
 fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love 
 to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish 
 cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from 
 Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham 
 battles on the <NUM> acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the 
 march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O 
 the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made 
 his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me 
 a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen 
 up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like 
 I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going 
 round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave 
 this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the 
 knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or 
 tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go 
 and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money 
 and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I 
 could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when 
 I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the 
 expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with 
 his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat 
 always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from 
 behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the 
 dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so 
 quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the 
 way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish 
 tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly 
 welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he 
 was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the 
 stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost <NUM> 
 quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for 
 me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that 
 sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming 
 back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor 
 looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first 
 noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I 
 wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my 
 fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for 
 I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers 
 were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have 
 slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always 
 hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down 
 your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a 
 great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case 
 if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one 
 thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I 
 think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them 
 either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she 
 didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of 
 silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought 
 them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one 
 change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into 
 him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id 
 want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips 
 he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a 
 delightful figure line <NUM> / <NUM> obviating that unsightly broad appearance 
 across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill 
 have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it 
 the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his 
 money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a 
 cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret 
 that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die 
 of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that 
 antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the 
 fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats 
 all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was 
 the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like 
 new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place 
 and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to 
 him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to 
 wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax 
 and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the 
 skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger 
 after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry 
 handkerchiefs about <NUM> / - in all sure you cant get on in this world 
 without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it 
 around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea 
 into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues 
 itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all 
 the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners 
 <NUM> whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the 
 other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because 
 they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every 
 day for the <NUM> years more I have of life up to <NUM> no Im what am I at all 
 Ill be <NUM> in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith 
 shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys 
 on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down 
 to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham 
 street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it 
 as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the 
 day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of 
 Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads 
 only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black 
 mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she <NUM> there was some funny 
 story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster 
 knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and 
 the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing 
 like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master 
 Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her 
 ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and 
 her a e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that 
 pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody 
 can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that 
 twice I remember when I came to page <NUM> the part about where she hangs 
 him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a 
 woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out 
 of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the 
 crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have 
 a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of 
 her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and 
 she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar 
 the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted 
 the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me 
 too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to 
 chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it 
 and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank 
 where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day 
 of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with 
 him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe 
 like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching 
 about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still 
 only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could 
 have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada 
 once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly 
 Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I 
 lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming 
 into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no 
 good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as 
 I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot 
 of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me 
 altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and 
 cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I 
 went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes 
 take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles 
 off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my 
 backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in 
 Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as 
 insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were 
 giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of 
 her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second 
 time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see 
 him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for 
 me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs 
 Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him 
 being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled 
 I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely 
 sorry and Im sure you were 
 
 yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he 
 made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one 
 anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep 
 that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out 
 for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made <NUM> 
 the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up 
 there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide 
 it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a 
 man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down 
 out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it 
 with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat 
 market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the 
 statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was 
 pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one 
 side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved 
 them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed 
 outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to 
 try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was <NUM> of the <NUM> 
 wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night 
 coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade 
 to make you feel nice and watery I went into <NUM> of them it was so biting 
 cold I couldnt keep it when was that <NUM> the canal was frozen yes it was 
 a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see 
 me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it 
 before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not 
 afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the 
 woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for 
 a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the 
 job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee 
 palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes 
 only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish 
 photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her 
 and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some 
 jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply 
 the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of 
 the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his 
 teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent 
 they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly 
 enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a 
 pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate 
 looking student that stopped in no <NUM> with the Citrons Penrose nearly 
 caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to 
 my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till 
 he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get 
 him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker 
 than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond 
 everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only 
 could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it 
 the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an 
 hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant 
 I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those 
 men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch 
 myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come 
 again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when 
 he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was 
 coming for about <NUM> minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him 
 after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or 
 anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain 
 who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man 
 theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice 
 about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my 
 eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue 
 between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday 
 two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday 
 
 frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those 
 engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and 
 out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor 
 men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in 
 those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half 
 of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying

 C I ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there 
 for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres 
 last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the 
 hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and 
 refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get 
 like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on 
 black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big 
 giant compared with their <NUM> Rock mountain they think is so great with 
 the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and 
 the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time 
 weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs 
 Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest

 Captain Grove with love yrs affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit 
 married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was 
 awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to 
 step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was 
 given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them 
 expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic 
 all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or 
 jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious 
 old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the <NUM> 
 things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the 
 women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole 
 insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all 
 my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking 
 in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose 
 theyre dead long ago the <NUM> of them its like all through a mist makes 
 you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to 
 myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker 
 than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up 
 and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we 
 were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in 
 her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning 
 with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an 
 opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father 
 and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the 
 windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like 
 all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at 
 myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was 
 attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent 
 looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the 
 shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the 
 excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been 
 nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me 
 the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East 
 Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by 
 that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as 
 he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave 
 me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a 
 Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a 
 whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards 
 of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one 
 decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and 
 his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my 
 shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the 
 chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on 
 the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them 
 at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago 
 it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her 
 address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were 
 always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and 
 the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those 
 Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything 
 he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was 
 blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I 
 did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a 
 Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage 
 made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it 
 got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run 
 away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or 
 aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me 
 waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and 
 booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing 
 everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when 
 general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great 
 fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there 
 from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the 
 son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums 
 rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with 
 messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their 
 jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men 
 to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the 
 gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about 
 Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum 
 lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil 
 with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his 
 nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner 
 but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room 
 on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky 
 talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along 
 I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a 
 letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with 
 bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails 
 listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an 
 instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your 
 hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me 
 looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the 
 opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after when I 
 put on my gloves and hat at the window to show I was going out not a 
 notion what I meant arent they thick never understand what you say even 
 youd want to print it up on a big poster for them not even if you shake 
 hands twice with the left he didnt recognise me either when I half 
 frowned at him outside Westland row chapel where does their great 
 intelligence come in Id like to know grey matter they have it all in 
 their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the City Arms 
 intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they 
 were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to 
 swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of 
 paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a 
 poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some 
 advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear Madam 
 only his letter and the card from Milly this morning see she wrote a 
 letter to him who did I get the last letter from O Mrs Dwenn now what 
 possessed her to write from Canada after so many years to know the 
 recipe I had for pisto madrileno Floey Dillon since she wrote to say 
 she was married to a very rich architect if Im to believe all I hear 
 with a villa and eight rooms her father was an awfully nice man he was 
 near seventy always goodhumoured well now Miss Tweedy or Miss Gillespie 
 theres the piannyer that was a solid silver coffee service he had too 
 on the mahogany sideboard then dying so far away I hate people that 
 have always their poor story to tell everybody has their own troubles 
 that poor Nancy Blake died a month ago of acute neumonia well I didnt 
 know her so well as all that she was Floeys friend more than mine poor 
 Nancy its a bother having to answer he always tells me the wrong things 
 and no stops to say like making a speech your sad bereavement 
 symph athy I always make that mistake and new phew with <NUM> double yous 
 in I hope hell write me a longer letter the next time if its a thing he 
 really likes me O thanks be to the great God I got somebody to give me

 all in this place like you used long ago I wish somebody would write me 
 a loveletter his wasnt much and I told him he could write what he liked 
 yours ever Hugh Boylan in old Madrid stuff silly women believe love is 
 sighing I am dying still if he wrote it I suppose thered be some truth 
 in it true or no it fills up your whole day and life always something 
 to think about every moment and see it all round you like a new world I 
 could write the answer in bed to let him imagine me short just a few 
 words not those long crossed letters Atty Dillon used to write to the 
 fellow that was something in the four courts that jilted her after out 
 of the ladies letterwriter when I told her to say a few simple words he 
 could twist how he liked not acting with precipat precipitancy with 
 equal candour the greatest earthly happiness answer to a gentlemans 
 proposal affirmatively my goodness theres nothing else its all very 
 fine for them but as for being a woman as soon as youre old they might 
 as well throw you out in the bottom of the ashpit . <end>   4.620112566508979
<start> <start> Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio 
 brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her 
 to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin 
 to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her 
 in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her 
 appearance ugly as she was near <NUM> or a <NUM> her face a mass of wrinkles 
 with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the 
 Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack 
 flying with all her carabineros because <NUM> drunken English sailors took 
 all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough 
 in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there 
 was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black 
 blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing <NUM> times on 
 Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell 
 bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an 
 admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him 
 up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window 
 then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making 
 an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it 
 up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill 
 instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps 
 singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the 
 old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under 
 the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what 
 kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was 
 sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way 
 what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish 
 nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to 
 be married to him in <NUM> years time theres many a true word spoken in 
 jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about 
 myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I 
 suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all 
 the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and 
 the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the 
 black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it 
 was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in 
 the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the 
 rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all 
 about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail 
 careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was 
 a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and 
 throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that 
 white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could 
 without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was 
 tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be 
 the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those 
 frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever 
 they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots 
 Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when 
 they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing 
 yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever 
 he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I 
 was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness 
 out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last 
 day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he 
 wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was 
 awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me 
 with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop 
 even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was 
 afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once 
 took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered 
 with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of 
 youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with 
 you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling 
 there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I 
 pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I 
 opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I 
 had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first 
 tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt 
 awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the 
 same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got 
 over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back 
 the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the 
 middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was 
 his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was 
 rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the 
 whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed 
 come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed 
 do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now 
 flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly <NUM> 
 years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put 
 his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young 
 still about <NUM> perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is 
 quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has 
 she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever 
 dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you 
 might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I 
 was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in 
 from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and 
 pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle 
 hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to 
 read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he 
 hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he 
 always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso 
 swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long 
 preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle 
 and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and 
 me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that 
 would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it 
 looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M 
 Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well 
 its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with 
 bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I 
 wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my 
 mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows 
 after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along 
 Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other 
 side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like 
 Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down 
 at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars 
 pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was 
 to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world 
 and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while 
 they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up 
 Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that 
 was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from 
 on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral 
 necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay 
 of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits 
 like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the 
 sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at 
 the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow 
 for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that 
 Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on 
 you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me 
 that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south 
 Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they 
 were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it 
 like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure <NUM> carrot gold 
 because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that 
 the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to 
 the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that 
 was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven

 heat I couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man in 
 the porkbutchers is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill 
 my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all 
 night I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see 
 why am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter 
 its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was 
 only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes 
 dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those 
 mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with 
 the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing 
 about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite 
 used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the 
 summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then 
 stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the 
 chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were <NUM> of us 
 goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get 
 in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again 
 coming in at <NUM> in the morning it must be if not more still he had the 
 manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night 
 squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink 
 water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon 
 haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like 
 the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down 
 in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling 
 up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then 
 play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has 
 she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate 
 their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like 
 that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I 
 wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think 
 Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with 
 some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those <NUM> lb 
 pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and 
 Woods goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes 
 Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for <NUM> forgetting 
 anyway Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin 
 chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck 
 the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave <NUM> / - each and or 
 let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and 
 drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him 
 examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters 
 no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed 
 sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks 
 there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday 
 anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit 
 Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the 
 seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after 
 him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked 
 could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it 
 came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all 
 down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the 
 tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping 
 out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of 
 course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his 
 flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all 
 the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was 
 black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed 
 chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City 
 Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he 
 wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was 
 no love lost between us thats <NUM> consolation I wonder what kind is that 
 book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other 
 Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with 
 his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white 
 shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather 
 all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell 
 of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan 
 bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the 
 fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa 
 and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to 
 climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago 
 besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at 
 night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of 
 salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was 
 going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or 
 Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the 
 way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he 
 was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely 
 places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the 
 gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of 
 and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was 
 going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry 
 my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the 
 plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old 
 beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and 
 put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of 
 that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news <NUM> years in 
 jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine 
 his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles 
 away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows 
 to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a 
 madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute 
 like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed 
 Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better 
 than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and 
 he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was 
 looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits 
 making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit 
 there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling 
 especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl 
 down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather 
 instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not 
 like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the 
 same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way 
 he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the 
 place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming 
 in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as 
 I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then 
 doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to 
 look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack 
 statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got 
 that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for <NUM> 
 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right 
 not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at 
 the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to 
 understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant 
 say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and 
 helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its 
 me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on 
 the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now 
 shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me 
 whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly 
 come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her 
 round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well 
 he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to 
 go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I 
 smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I 
 sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I 
 tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a 
 parting and the last plumpudding too split in <NUM> halves see it comes out 
 no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your 
 blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle 
 blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on 
 show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at 
 her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you 
 then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the 
 Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me 
 afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that 
 touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always 
 trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for 
 Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed 
 like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me 
 there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to 
 get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same 
 little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but 
 he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the 
 Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance 
 on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands 
 swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything 
 deep yet I never came properly till I was what <NUM> or so it went into 
 the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that 
 Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with 
 sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he 
 looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and 
 supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man 
 gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a 
 few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it 
 really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love 
 in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each 
 other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit 
 foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and 
 poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes 
 always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to 
 put her hair up at <NUM> my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time 
 enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes 
 pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too 
 but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a 
 fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we 
 met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to 
 see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough 
 till I gave her <NUM> damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that 
 now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me 
 that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because 
 how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night 
 before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to 
 leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as 
 she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was 
 the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself 
 they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the 
 two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever 
 going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming 
 Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that 
 old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the 
 things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course 
 shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly 
 dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something 
 and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends 
 to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you 
 please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father 
 such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the 
 cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at 
 the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won 
 them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody 
 saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand 
 funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody 
 hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head 
 I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been 
 hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the 
 ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was 
 something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and 
 now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband 
 getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they 
 have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats 
 her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres 
 some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead 
 in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if 
 Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt 
 that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he 
 had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that 
 pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows 
 theres always something wrong with us <NUM> days every <NUM> or <NUM> weeks usual 
 monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like 
 that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him 
 to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about 
 insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt 
 give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his 
 glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul 
 thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could 
 all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it 
 out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry 
 supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery 
 hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a 
 woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up 
 for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is 
 better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience 
 above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me 
 pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just 
 put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn 
 it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a 
 virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you 
 could be a widow or divorced <NUM> times over a daub of red ink would do 
 or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this 
 pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what 
 between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too 
 jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the 
 other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor 
 with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think 
 it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I 
 might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next 
 time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face 
 wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me 
 after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I 
 made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse 
 and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be 
 he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits 
 easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling 
 like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for 
 a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning 
 dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look 
 how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit 
 here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get 
 up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey 
 lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore 
 
 who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I 
 something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when 
 was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about <NUM> weeks I ought to go to 
 the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that 
 white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick 
 Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called 
 it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting 
 round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every 
 little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of 
 course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last 
 man in the world besides theres something queer about their children 
 always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what 
 I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one 
 thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly 
 old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and 
 could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the 
 rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by 
 the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I 
 can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and 
 needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by 
 Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the 
 same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and 
 asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all 
 the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked 
 sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows 
 what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out 
 frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you 
 lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever 
 enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad 
 crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious 
 Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and 
 of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he 
 had me always at myself <NUM> and <NUM> times a day sometimes and I said I 
 hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him 
 up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited 
 me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in 
 Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about <NUM> minutes 
 as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking 
 after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half 
 sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand 
 for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his 
 blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool 
 of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O 
 beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and 
 rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy 
 anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st 
 opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom 
 pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk 
 and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I 
 laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight 
 sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so 
 that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose 
 there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at 
 the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard 
 bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth 
 breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to 
 show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a 
 pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out 
 that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put 
 together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody 
 I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big 
 square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway 
 wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt 
 creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere 
 still she must have given him great value for his money of course he 
 has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll 
 have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God 
 help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always 
 reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often 
 enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to 
 admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like 
 my bed God here we are as bad as ever after <NUM> years how many houses 
 were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard 
 street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on 
 the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the 
 men with our <NUM> sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse 
 and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always 
 somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always 
 know who was in there last every time were just getting on right 
 something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr 
 Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old 
 lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives 
 impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the 
 Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the 
 freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along 
 in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much 
 consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed 
 judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres 
 Georges church bells wait <NUM> quarters the hour wait two oclock well 
 thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody 
 climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that 
 little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if 
 he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I 
 dont know deceitful men all their <NUM> pockets arent enough for their 
 lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont 
 believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats 
 Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in 
 real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is 
 disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads 
 and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about 
 with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow 
 poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both 
 sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let 
 him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the 
 one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews 
 used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast 
 or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough 
 for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his 
 own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that 
 wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and 
 lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder 
 was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too 
 no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants 
 me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that 
 forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some 
 little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the 
 College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his 
 nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at 
 those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no 
 use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr 
 Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in 
 the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd 
 be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind 
 in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that 
 bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or 
 other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys 
 husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye 
 trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old 
 green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way 
 like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call 
 that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with 
 their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping 
 that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be 
 sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still 
 though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of 
 them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches 
 if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well 
 when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to 
 squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after 
 his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im 
 sorry in a way for him what are his wife and <NUM> children going to do 
 unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some 
 pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come 
 home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully 
 becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at 
 the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he 
 borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and 
 squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a 
 wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough 
 that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying <NUM> / - in the 
 preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and 
 Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the 
 second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly 
 sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying 
 too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had 
 a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart 
 _sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_ 
 goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in 
 it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we 
 sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even 
 transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed 
 say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I 
 wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a 
 university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he 
 driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have 
 got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look 
 young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and 
 me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge 
 station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats <NUM> years ago 
 now yes hed be <NUM> though what was the good in going into mourning for 
 what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for 
 me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted 
 hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time 
 he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord 
 Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw 
 him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God 
 yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out 
 the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met 
 before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either 
 besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after 
 that the <NUM> of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on 
 its way and scandals too the <NUM> queens and the <NUM> of diamonds for a rise 
 in society yes wait it all came out and <NUM> red 8s for new garments look 
 at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about 
 poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or 
 standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only 
 getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry 
 when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not 
 an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I 
 wonder is he too young hes about wait <NUM> I was married <NUM> Milly is <NUM> 
 yesterday <NUM> what age was he then at Dillons <NUM> or <NUM> about <NUM> I suppose 
 hes <NUM> or more Im not too old for him if hes <NUM> or <NUM> I hope hes not 
 that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting 
 down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of 
 course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was 
 out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not 
 a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson 
 they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont 
 find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where 
 poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully 
 coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point 
 the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back 
 there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that 
 for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly 
 bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young 
 star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to 
 talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts 
 ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in 
 their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like 
 to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young 
 those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace 
 from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or 
 something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men 
 like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely 
 little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and 
 his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and 
 poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his 
 lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth 
 if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and 
 white he looks with his boyish face I would too in <NUM> / <NUM> a minute even if 
 some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no 
 danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I 
 suppose never dream of washing it from <NUM> years end to the other the 
 most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure 
 itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age 
 Ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard 
 comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out 
 Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew 
 who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the 
 same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him 
 till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and 
 mistress publicly too with our <NUM> photographs in all the papers when he 
 becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though 
 
 no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no 
 nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because 
 I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a 
 cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place 
 pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so 
 barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar 
 way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a 
 butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course 
 hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might 
 as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something 
 better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its 
 because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he 
 couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the 
 amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white 
 for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with 
 that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so 
 soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those 
 cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has 
 a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it 
 didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts 
 his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be 
 you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick 
 and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl 
 for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street 
 no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me 
 up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands 
 jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling 
 her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if 
 he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he 
 going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course 
 the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either 
 its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all 
 those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can 
 I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with 
 him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the 
 wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a 
 womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything 
 unnatural where we havent <NUM> atom of any kind of expression in us all of 
 us the same <NUM> lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the 
 dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita 
 theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a 
 madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a 
 woman wants to be embraced <NUM> times a day almost to make her look young 
 no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the 
 fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking 
 would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd 
 know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not 
 care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of 
 those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near 
 the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only 
 sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back 
 over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow 
 with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me 
 up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do 
 themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up 
 somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us 
 the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course 
 it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and 
 when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after 
 coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his 
 wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten 
 again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the 
 love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well 
 he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he 
 knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to 
 sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between <NUM> 7s too in prison for 
 Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around 
 down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled 
 up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like 
 to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I 
 dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be 
 governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one 
 another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around 
 drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on 
 horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop 
 sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know 
 what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they 
 all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I 
 never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away 
 from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the 
 usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a 
 fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to 
 make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two 
 dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that 
 disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in 
 that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some 
 poor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it 
 was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into 
 the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I 
 felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of 
 roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and 
 pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining 
 himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to 
 love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends 
 they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some 
 woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder 
 they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I 
 suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like 
 that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I 
 suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly <NUM> of me in the 
 next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I 
 wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had 
 the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave 
 me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and 
 Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown 
 myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the 
 bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and 
 Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am 
 a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day

 Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the 
 two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the 
 Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant 
 what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and 
 wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in 
 bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad 
 luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and 
 something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might 
 like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the 
 criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you 
 see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself 
 not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend 
 we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is 
 dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head 
 sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres 
 the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his 
 writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he 
 does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes 
 making the breakfast for <NUM> he can make it for <NUM> Im sure Im not going to 
 take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house

 person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with 
 the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown

 him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right 
 its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery 
 said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of 
 tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I 
 suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt 
 have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to 
 kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his 
 face as large as life he can stick his tongue <NUM> miles up my hole as hes 
 there my brown part then Ill tell him I want <NUM> or perhaps <NUM> / - Ill 
 tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he 
 wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women 
 do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write 
 his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it 
 up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided 
 he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill

 heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and 
 the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats 
 and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about 
 that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all 
 sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the 
 ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no 
 God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why 
 dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or 
 whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves 
 first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why 
 because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes 
 I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there 
 was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so

 tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the 
 rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat 
 the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of 
 seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes <NUM> years ago 
 my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a 
 flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that 
 was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today 
 yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a 
 woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the 
 pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I 
 wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was 
 thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and 
 Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all 
 birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the 
 pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing 
 round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls 
 laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the 
 morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who 
 else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market 
 all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half 
 asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the 
 steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle 
 thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and 
 turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop 
 and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas <NUM> glancing eyes a lattice 
 hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night 
 and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the 
 watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown 
 torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the 
 glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all 
 the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and 
 the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and 
 Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put 
 the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a 
 red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well 
 as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again 
 yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and 
 first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could 
 feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and 
 yes I said yes I will Yes . <end>   4.323982610257008
