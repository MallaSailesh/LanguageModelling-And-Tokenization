 CHAPTER I . 
 
 
 It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession 
 of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife . <end>   3.829776041580995
<start> <start> However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his 
 first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds 
 of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful 
 property of some one or other of their daughters . <end>   4.485468325624073
<start> <start> " But it is , " returned she ; " for Mrs . <end>   5.891134454994344
<start> <start> Long has just been here , and she 
 told me all about it . " 
 
 Mr . Bennet made no answer . <end>   4.876093675225007
<start> <start> " Do not you want to know who has taken it ? " cried his wife impatiently . <end>   5.2710540207826035
<start> <start> " _You_ want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . " 
 
 This was invitation enough . <end>   4.801549970536875
<start> <start> " Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs . <end>   4.593269787268614
<start> <start> Long says that Netherfield is taken 
 by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came 
 down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much 
 delighted with it that he agreed with Mr . Morris immediately ; that he is 
 to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be 
 in the house by the end of next week . " 
 
 " What is his name ? " 
 
 " Bingley . " 
 
 " Is he married or single ? " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   4.514415161594553
<start> <start> A single man of large fortune ; four 
 or five thousand a year . <end>   3.3360528325664984
<start> <start> What a fine thing for our girls ! " 
 
 " How so ? <end>   4.136200902695962
<start> <start> how can it affect them ? " 
 
 " My dear Mr . Bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome ! <end>   4.518151094920368
<start> <start> You 
 must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . " 
 
 " Is that his design in settling here ? " 
 
 " Design ! <end>   5.080307411061646
<start> <start> But it is very likely that he 
 _may_ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as 
 soon as he comes . " 
 
 " I see no occasion for that . <end>   4.832088744227543
<start> <start> You and the girls may go , or you may send 
 them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are 
 as handsome as any of them , Mr . Bingley might like you the best of the 
 party . " 
 
 " My dear , you flatter me . <end>   5.8831954048478226
<start> <start> I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty , but 
 I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now . <end>   5.954294185422325
<start> <start> When a woman has 
 five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own 
 beauty . " 
 
 " In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . " 
 
 " But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr . Bingley when he comes into 
 the neighbourhood . " 
 
 " It is more than I engage for , I assure you . " 
 
 " But consider your daughters . <end>   4.337813554946313
<start> <start> Only think what an establishment it would 
 be for one of them . <end>   4.591935672380211
<start> <start> Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , 
 merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new 
 comers . <end>   4.6835590865111065
<start> <start> Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit 
 him , if you do not . " 
 
 " You are over scrupulous surely . <end>   5.005734831942852
<start> <start> I dare say Mr . Bingley will be very 
 glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my 
 hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though 
 I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . " 
 
 " I desire you will do no such thing . <end>   5.282506255844872
<start> <start> But you are always giving _her_ the 
 preference . " 
 
 " They have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he ; " they are 
 all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of 
 quickness than her sisters . " 
 
 " Mr . Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? <end>   4.46209862703522
<start> <start> You have no compassion on my poor nerves . " 
 
 " You mistake me , my dear . <end>   4.228156649080611
<start> <start> I have a high respect for your nerves . <end>   5.910140128579443
<start> <start> I have heard you mention them with consideration 
 these twenty years at least . " 
 
 " Ah ! <end>   3.270482327049219
<start> <start> you do not know what I suffer . " 
 
 " But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four 
 thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . " 
 
 " It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not 
 visit them . " 
 
 " Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them 
 all . " 
 
 Mr . Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , 
 reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had 
 been insufficient to make his wife understand his character . <end>   4.522102132263085
<start> <start> _Her_ mind 
 was less difficult to develope . <end>   5.779793478178846
<start> <start> She was a woman of mean understanding , 
 little information , and uncertain temper . <end>   9.188190501760584
<start> <start> When she was discontented she 
 fancied herself nervous . <end>   4.995054989654433
<start> <start> The business of her life was to get her 
 daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news . <end>   5.21273762102973
<start> <start> CHAPTER II . 
 
 
 Mr . Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr . Bingley . <end>   4.3791129347261135
<start> <start> It was then disclosed in the following 
 manner . <end>   6.60132275559659
<start> <start> Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he 
 suddenly addressed her with , 
 
 " I hope Mr . Bingley will like it Lizzy . " 
 
 " We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr . Bingley likes , " said her mother 
 resentfully , " since we are not to visit . " 
 
 " But you forget , mama , " said Elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the 
 assemblies , and that Mrs . <end>   5.221113803111381
<start> <start> Long has promised to introduce him . " 
 
 " I do not believe Mrs . <end>   3.490321522133767
<start> <start> Long will do any such thing . <end>   5.519917526651404
<start> <start> She has two nieces 
 of her own . <end>   5.089109225917434
<start> <start> She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion 
 of her . " 
 
 " No more have I , " said Mr . Bennet ; " and I am glad to find that you do 
 not depend on her serving you . " 
 
 Mrs . <end>   5.1686058807545265
<start> <start> Bennet deigned not to make any reply ; but unable to contain 
 herself , began scolding one of her daughters . <end>   6.328040399733042
<start> <start> " Don 't keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven 's sake ! <end>   4.495140836861331
<start> <start> You tear them to pieces . " 
 
 " Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , " said her father ; " she times 
 them ill . " 
 
 " I do not cough for my own amusement , " replied Kitty fretfully . <end>   4.401966637708104
<start> <start> " When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? " 
 
 " To - morrow fortnight . " 
 
 " Aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and Mrs . <end>   5.089075704073428
<start> <start> Long does not come back 
 till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , 
 for she will not know him herself . " 
 
 " Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce 
 Mr . Bingley to _her_ . " 
 
 " Impossible , Mr . Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him 
 myself ; how can you be so teazing ? " 
 
 " I honour your circumspection . <end>   5.8449388809864375
<start> <start> A fortnight 's acquaintance is certainly 
 very little . <end>   5.244525594756478
<start> <start> One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a 
 fortnight . <end>   6.318577824319246
<start> <start> But if _we_ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after 
 all , Mrs . <end>   4.979924119650263
<start> <start> Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as 
 she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will 
 take it on myself . " 
 
 The girls stared at their father . <end>   5.169102278965828
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet said only , " Nonsense , 
 nonsense ! " 
 
 " What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? " cried he . <end>   5.555695634513359
<start> <start> " Do 
 you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on 
 them , as nonsense ? <end>   6.207011709481434
<start> <start> I cannot quite agree with you _there_ . <end>   5.369091316454732
<start> <start> What say you , 
 Mary ? <end>   14.108028722981315
<start> <start> for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great 
 books , and make extracts . " 
 
 Mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how . <end>   6.084356115821597
<start> <start> If I 
 had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on 
 him . <end>   9.583040035712203
<start> <start> It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we 
 cannot escape the acquaintance now . " 
 
 The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs . <end>   4.855050830149989
<start> <start> " How good it was in you , my dear Mr . Bennet ! <end>   7.967345512585497
<start> <start> I was sure you loved your girls too well to 
 neglect such an acquaintance . <end>   4.288542824837582
<start> <start> Well , how pleased I am ! <end>   9.605841555528066
<start> <start> and it is such a 
 good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said 
 a word about it till now . " 
 
 " Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said Mr . Bennet ; and , 
 as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife . <end>   6.300666513517391
<start> <start> " What an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was 
 shut . <end>   5.74554320144147
<start> <start> " I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; 
 or me either , for that matter . <end>   5.745642868169114
<start> <start> At our time of life , it is not so 
 pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but 
 for your sakes , we would do any thing . <end>   5.929741175744985
<start> <start> Bennet , however , with the assistance of her five 
 daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her 
 husband any satisfactory description of Mr . Bingley . <end>   5.205384778665119
<start> <start> They attacked him 
 in various ways ; with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and 
 distant surmises ; but he eluded the skill of them all ; and they were at 
 last obliged to accept the second - hand intelligence of their neighbour 
 Lady Lucas . <end>   3.785639613847601
<start> <start> Sir William had been 
 delighted with him . <end>   6.536557838381348
<start> <start> He was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely 
 agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly 
 with a large party . <end>   5.376917840705109
<start> <start> Nothing could be more delightful ! <end>   5.692217682523617
<start> <start> To be fond of 
 dancing was a certain step towards falling in love ; and very lively 
 hopes of Mr . Bingley 's heart were entertained . <end>   4.239458663919453
<start> <start> " If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , " 
 said Mrs . <end>   6.512892190351081
<start> <start> Bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well 
 married , I shall have nothing to wish for . " 
 
 In a few days Mr . Bingley returned Mr . Bennet 's visit , and sat about ten 
 minutes with him in his library . <end>   6.874036657000181
<start> <start> He had entertained hopes of being 
 admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard 
 much ; but he saw only the father . <end>   4.732197970030152
<start> <start> The ladies were somewhat more 
 fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper 
 window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse . <end>   3.5671585129917154
<start> <start> An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched ; and already had 
 Mrs . <end>   7.171773956117655
<start> <start> Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her 
 housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all . <end>   4.421800873251444
<start> <start> Mr . Bingley 
 was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to 
 accept the honour of their invitation , & c . <end>   6.4698037965218935
<start> <start> Bennet was quite 
 disconcerted . <end>   5.926454620409618
<start> <start> She could not imagine what business he could have in town 
 so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire ; and she began to fear that 
 he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never 
 settled at Netherfield as he ought to be . <end>   5.731538606130624
<start> <start> Lady Lucas quieted her fears a 
 little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a 
 large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that Mr . Bingley 
 was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly . <end>   4.589793924214745
<start> <start> The girls grieved over such a number of ladies ; but were comforted the 
 day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought 
 only six with him from London , his five sisters and a cousin . <end>   5.6227814037855826
<start> <start> And when 
 the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five 
 altogether ; Mr . Bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and 
 another young man . <end>   7.790356499330711
<start> <start> His sisters were fine women , 
 with an air of decided fashion . <end>   4.049842569425219
<start> <start> The gentlemen 
 pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was 
 much handsomer than Mr . Bingley , and he was looked at with great 
 admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust 
 which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be 
 proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his 
 large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most 
 forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared 
 with his friend . <end>   4.872048524936131
<start> <start> Mr . Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal 
 people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , 
 was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one 
 himself at Netherfield . <end>   4.736172237936087
<start> <start> Such amiable qualities must speak for 
 themselves . <end>   3.6777063362841105
<start> <start> What a contrast between him and his friend ! <end>   5.7899487958187
<start> <start> Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , declined being 
 introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in 
 walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party . <end>   5.774254264405494
<start> <start> His character was decided . <end>   4.090066021694406
<start> <start> He was the proudest , most disagreeable man in 
 the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again . <end>   5.641697942815515
<start> <start> Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs . <end>   4.557315127626579
<start> <start> Bennet , whose dislike of 
 his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his 
 having slighted one of her daughters . <end>   5.924816595604488
<start> <start> Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit 
 down for two dances ; and during part of that time , Mr . Darcy had been 
 standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and 
 Mr . Bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his 
 friend to join it . <end>   5.875606012118583
<start> <start> You had much better 
 dance . " 
 
 " I certainly shall not . <end>   4.627580015688953
<start> <start> You know how I detest it , unless I am 
 particularly acquainted with my partner . <end>   6.244280150629669
<start> <start> At such an assembly as this , it 
 would be insupportable . <end>   5.825504419325241
<start> <start> Your sisters are engaged , and there is not 
 another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to 
 stand up with . " 
 
 " I would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried Bingley , " for a 
 kingdom ! <end>   7.413926709295729
<start> <start> Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my 
 life , as I have this evening ; and there are several of them you see 
 uncommonly pretty . " 
 
 " _You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said Mr . 
 Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet . <end>   5.5395770933263835
<start> <start> she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! <end>   6.69294247877839
<start> <start> But there is one 
 of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I 
 dare say , very agreeable . <end>   6.611419721821095
<start> <start> Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . " 
 
 " Which do you mean ? " and turning round , he looked for a moment at 
 Elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , 
 " She is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_ ; and I am in no 
 humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted 
 by other men . <end>   5.028492356982805
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy walked off ; and Elizabeth 
 remained with no very cordial feelings towards him . <end>   3.7979011406030465
<start> <start> She told the story 
 however with great spirit among her friends ; for she had a lively , 
 playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous . <end>   5.8062530897830875
<start> <start> The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family . <end>   4.506613312864844
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Mr . Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been 
 distinguished by his sisters . <end>   6.2232733606578075
<start> <start> Jane was as much gratified by this , as her 
 mother could be , though in a quieter way . <end>   7.73121830613161
<start> <start> Elizabeth felt Jane 's 
 pleasure . <end>   9.015445050503049
<start> <start> Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most 
 accomplished girl in the neighbourhood ; and Catherine and Lydia had been 
 fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they 
 had yet learnt to care for at a ball . <end>   5.602017019666361
<start> <start> They returned therefore in good 
 spirits to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they 
 were the principal inhabitants . <end>   6.434814280041134
<start> <start> They found Mr . Bennet still up . <end>   6.3049633842093655
<start> <start> He had rather hoped that all his wife 's 
 views on the stranger would be disappointed ; but he soon found that he 
 had a very different story to hear . <end>   6.285432233652459
<start> <start> my dear Mr . Bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most 
 delightful evening , a most excellent ball . <end>   6.640920718132506
<start> <start> Every body said how well 
 she looked ; and Mr . Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with 
 her twice . <end>   6.567624133553606
<start> <start> Only think of _that_ my dear ; he actually danced with her 
 twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second 
 time . <end>   6.307943622818926
<start> <start> I was so vexed to see him stand 
 up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody 
 can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going 
 down the dance . <end>   5.987982889625732
<start> <start> So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and 
 asked her for the two next . <end>   8.352453627795716
<start> <start> Then , the two third he danced with Miss 
 King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane 
 again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the Boulanger - - - - " 
 
 " If he had had any compassion for _me_ , " cried her husband impatiently , 
 " he would not have danced half so much ! <end>   5.990817153759615
<start> <start> For God 's sake , say no more of 
 his partners . <end>   4.1996089615475904
<start> <start> Oh ! <end>   7.296773763321134
<start> <start> that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance ! " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   4.445315729208703
<start> <start> Bennet , " I am quite delighted with him . <end>   5.33878936589625
<start> <start> He 
 is so excessively handsome ! <end>   4.657481182041609
<start> <start> and his sisters are charming women . <end>   4.811019629848108
<start> <start> I never 
 in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses . <end>   5.324198030894554
<start> <start> I dare say the 
 lace upon Mrs . <end>   5.801430226874952
<start> <start> Hurst 's gown - - - - " 
 
 Here she was interrupted again . <end>   6.361953399441335
<start> <start> Mr . Bennet protested against any 
 description of finery . <end>   3.9813013671801865
<start> <start> She was therefore obliged to seek another branch 
 of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some 
 exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of Mr . Darcy . <end>   4.476043663625811
<start> <start> " But I can assure you , " she added , " that Lizzy does not lose much by not 
 suiting _his_ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at 
 all worth pleasing . <end>   4.282997885329088
<start> <start> So high and so conceited that there was no enduring 
 him ! <end>   5.006719591515136
<start> <start> He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very 
 great ! <end>   6.313485803805191
<start> <start> Not handsome enough to dance with ! <end>   6.67500195926583
<start> <start> I quite detest the man . " 
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER IV . 
 
 
 When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in 
 her praise of Mr . Bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much 
 she admired him . <end>   5.660263461977684
<start> <start> " He is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good 
 humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! - - so much ease , 
 with such perfect good breeding ! " 
 
 " He is also handsome , " replied Elizabeth , " which a young man ought 
 likewise to be , if he possibly can . <end>   4.656631871557456
<start> <start> His character is thereby complete . " 
 
 " I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . <end>   4.548111509958555
<start> <start> I 
 did not expect such a compliment . " 
 
 " Did not you ? <end>   5.817716130751263
<start> <start> _I_ did for you . <end>   5.456869622292264
<start> <start> But that is one great difference between 
 us . <end>   4.046148631388884
<start> <start> Compliments always take _you_ by surprise , and _me_ never . <end>   4.93106971882102
<start> <start> What 
 could be more natural than his asking you again ? <end>   4.334771687400044
<start> <start> No thanks to his gallantry for that . <end>   5.138685789702944
<start> <start> Well , he certainly is 
 very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . <end>   7.498577329734197
<start> <start> you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general . <end>   6.55821081339147
<start> <start> You never see a fault in any body . <end>   5.319255724956887
<start> <start> All the world are good and agreeable 
 in your eyes . <end>   5.463037900749098
<start> <start> I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . " 
 
 " I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ; but I always speak 
 what I think . " 
 
 " I know you do ; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder . <end>   4.520462965563817
<start> <start> Affectation of candour is common enough ; - - one meets it every 
 where . <end>   3.885685795471432
<start> <start> But to be candid without ostentation or design - - to take the good 
 of every body 's character and make it still better , and say nothing of 
 the bad - - belongs to you alone . <end>   6.829051489517236
<start> <start> Their manners are not equal to his . " 
 
 " Certainly not ; at first . <end>   5.2449596534645355
<start> <start> But they are very pleasing women when you 
 converse with them . <end>   5.4098639980221686
<start> <start> Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep 
 his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming 
 neighbour in her . " 
 
 Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced ; their behaviour at 
 the assembly had not been calculated to please in general ; and with more 
 quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and 
 with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very 
 little disposed to approve them . <end>   4.740525240378375
<start> <start> They were in fact very fine ladies ; not 
 deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of 
 being agreeable where they chose it ; but proud and conceited . <end>   4.62815824579503
<start> <start> They were 
 rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private 
 seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the 
 habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people 
 of rank ; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of 
 themselves , and meanly of others . <end>   5.180468876833335
<start> <start> They were of a respectable family in 
 the north of England ; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their 
 memories than that their brother 's fortune and their own had been 
 acquired by trade . <end>   3.8634511162279934
<start> <start> Mr . Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred 
 thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , 
 but did not live to do it . - - Mr . Bingley intended it likewise , and 
 sometimes made choice of his county ; but as he was now provided with a 
 good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those 
 who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the 
 remainder of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next generation to 
 purchase . <end>   5.141513977071152
<start> <start> His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but 
 though he was now established only as a tenant , Miss Bingley was by no 
 means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was Mrs . <end>   4.662403144414282
<start> <start> Hurst , who had 
 married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider 
 his house as her home when it suited her . <end>   4.551340291733232
<start> <start> Mr . Bingley had not been of 
 age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to 
 look at Netherfield House . <end>   5.777845713837804
<start> <start> Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a 
 great opposition of character . - - Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the 
 easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could 
 offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never 
 appeared dissatisfied . <end>   4.622872917857045
<start> <start> On the strength of Darcy 's regard Bingley had the 
 firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . <end>   5.373342657449945
<start> <start> In 
 understanding Darcy was the superior . <end>   6.704113645898733
<start> <start> Bingley was by no means deficient , 
 but Darcy was clever . <end>   5.520622214510634
<start> <start> He was at the same time haughty , reserved , and 
 fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . <end>   5.351277733341221
<start> <start> In 
 that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . <end>   6.008403891093641
<start> <start> Bingley was sure of 
 being liked wherever he appeared , Darcy was continually giving offence . <end>   4.386705537531725
<start> <start> The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently 
 characteristic . <end>   3.910111382392898
<start> <start> Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier 
 girls in his life ; every body had been most kind and attentive to him , 
 there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted 
 with all the room ; and as to Miss Bennet , he could not conceive an angel 
 more beautiful . <end>   5.621554268727931
<start> <start> Darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people 
 in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had 
 felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or 
 pleasure . <end>   5.516348338774967
<start> <start> Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too 
 much . <end>   5.911958523415033
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so - - but still they admired 
 her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom 
 they should not object to know more of . <end>   5.917009294635298
<start> <start> Miss Bennet was therefore 
 established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such 
 commendation to think of her as he chose . <end>   5.888129576417385
<start> <start> CHAPTER V . 
 
 
 Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets 
 were particularly intimate . <end>   4.3757699098908915
<start> <start> Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade 
 in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the 
 honour of knighthood by an address to the King , during his mayoralty . <end>   4.697173286553334
<start> <start> The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly . <end>   2.3347561286465313
<start> <start> For 
 though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the 
 contrary , he was all attention to every body . <end>   5.8337900789933
<start> <start> Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a 
 valuable neighbour to Mrs . <end>   4.409980499589509
<start> <start> Bennet . - - They had several children . <end>   6.828648428597438
<start> <start> The 
 eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty - seven , 
 was Elizabeth 's intimate friend . <end>   4.32098646212463
<start> <start> That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a 
 ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly 
 brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate . <end>   4.932165779172679
<start> <start> " _You_ began the evening well , Charlotte , " said Mrs . <end>   5.3821364970930246
<start> <start> To be 
 sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her - - indeed I rather believe he 
 _did_ - - I heard something about it - - but I hardly know what - - something 
 about Mr . Robinson . " 
 
 " Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr . Robinson ; did not 
 I mention it to you ? <end>   5.0480690987813315
<start> <start> Mr . Robinson 's asking him how he liked our Meryton 
 assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty 
 women in the room , and _which_ he thought the prettiest ? <end>   4.385918754231429
<start> <start> and his 
 answering immediately to the last question - - Oh ! <end>   6.423571429627902
<start> <start> the eldest Miss Bennet 
 beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point . " 
 
 " Upon my word ! - - Well , that was very decided indeed - - that does seem as 
 if - - - - but however , it may all come to nothing you know . " 
 
 " _My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_ , Eliza , " said 
 Charlotte . <end>   5.379525413636016
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Long told me last night that he 
 sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . " 
 
 " Are you quite sure , Ma 'am ? - - is not there a little mistake ? " said 
 Jane . - - " I certainly saw Mr . Darcy speaking to her . " 
 
 " Aye - - because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he 
 could not help answering her ; - - but she said he seemed very angry at 
 being spoke to . " 
 
 " Miss Bingley told me , " said Jane , " that he never speaks much unless 
 among his intimate acquaintance . <end>   4.76951411159911
<start> <start> Long . <end>   11.797203495511495
<start> <start> But I can guess how it was ; 
 every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had 
 heard somehow that Mrs . <end>   5.3278181908580295
<start> <start> Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to 
 the ball in a hack chaise . " 
 
 " I do not mind his not talking to Mrs . <end>   4.71861360314052
<start> <start> Long , " said Miss Lucas , " but I 
 wish he had danced with Eliza . " 
 
 " Another time , Lizzy , " said her mother , " I would not dance with _him_ , 
 if I were you . " 
 
 " I believe , Ma 'am , I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him . " 
 
 " His pride , " said Miss Lucas , " does not offend _me_ so much as pride 
 often does , because there is an excuse for it . <end>   4.744024298711649
<start> <start> If I may so express it , he has a _right_ 
 to be proud . " 
 
 " That is very true , " replied Elizabeth , " and I could easily forgive 
 _his_ pride , if he had not mortified _mine_ . " 
 
 " Pride , " observed Mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her 
 reflections , " is a very common failing I believe . <end>   4.690502636857966
<start> <start> By all that I have 
 ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human 
 nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us 
 who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some 
 quality or other , real or imaginary . <end>   5.0358211146939995
<start> <start> A person may be 
 proud without being vain . <end>   4.742014822360464
<start> <start> I would keep a pack of 
 foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day . " 
 
 " Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said Mrs . <end>   4.243255498655729
<start> <start> Bennet ; " and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle 
 directly . " 
 
 The boy protested that she should not ; she continued to declare that she 
 would , and the argument ended only with the visit . <end>   5.470398559239347
<start> <start> CHAPTER VI . 
 
 
 The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield . <end>   4.397613850459923
<start> <start> The visit 
 was returned in due form . <end>   4.399444631741025
<start> <start> Miss Bennet 's pleasing manners grew on the 
 good will of Mrs . <end>   4.59430921839104
<start> <start> By Jane this attention was received with the greatest 
 pleasure ; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of 
 every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them ; 
 though their kindness to Jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in 
 all probability from the influence of their brother 's admiration . <end>   5.2069074278766205
<start> <start> It was 
 generally evident whenever they met , that he _did_ admire her ; and to 
 _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference 
 which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a 
 way to be very much in love ; but she considered with pleasure that it 
 was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since Jane 
 united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a 
 uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the 
 suspicions of the impertinent . <end>   5.967870785772686
<start> <start> She mentioned this to her friend Miss 
 Lucas . <end>   6.318513493710684
<start> <start> " It may perhaps be pleasant , " replied Charlotte , " to be able to impose 
 on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be 
 so very guarded . <end>   5.797755386575855
<start> <start> If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill 
 from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and 
 it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the 
 dark . <end>   5.82304987197575
<start> <start> In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew _more_ 
 affection than she feels . <end>   4.115977325992991
<start> <start> If _I_ can 
 perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to 
 discover it too . " 
 
 " Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane 's disposition as you do . " 
 
 " But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal 
 it , he must find it out . " 
 
 " Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . <end>   5.071744206931459
<start> <start> But though Bingley and Jane 
 meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they 
 always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that 
 every moment should be employed in conversing together . <end>   4.2666646779478254
<start> <start> When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling 
 in love as much as she chuses . " 
 
 " Your plan is a good one , " replied Elizabeth , " where nothing is in 
 question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined 
 to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it . <end>   5.362634075025506
<start> <start> As yet , she 
 cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its 
 reasonableness . <end>   7.447554020327799
<start> <start> She has known him only a fortnight . <end>   6.223028010778212
<start> <start> She danced four 
 dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , 
 and has since dined in company with him four times . <end>   4.515103631677402
<start> <start> This is not quite 
 enough to make her understand his character . " 
 
 " Not as you represent it . <end>   4.3588307625944385
<start> <start> Had she merely _dined_ with him , she might 
 only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must 
 remember that four evenings have been also spent together - - and four 
 evenings may do a great deal . " 
 
 " Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both 
 like Vingt - un better than Commerce ; but with respect to any other 
 leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . " 
 
 " Well , " said Charlotte , " I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if 
 she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a 
 chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a 
 twelvemonth . <end>   4.366087116503196
<start> <start> If 
 the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or 
 ever so similar before - hand , it does not advance their felicity in the 
 least . <end>   5.781820318743599
<start> <start> They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to 
 have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as 
 possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your 
 life . " 
 
 " You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . <end>   4.820080868333584
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy had at first scarcely 
 allowed her to be pretty ; he had looked at her without admiration at the 
 ball ; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise . <end>   4.987192321113568
<start> <start> But no 
 sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had 
 hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered 
 uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . <end>   4.633630110963106
<start> <start> Though he had 
 detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry 
 in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and 
 pleasing ; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those 
 of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . <end>   5.098740826780428
<start> <start> Of 
 this she was perfectly unaware ; - - to her he was only the man who made 
 himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough 
 to dance with . <end>   6.765571159819742
<start> <start> It was at Sir William Lucas 's , where a large party were 
 assembled . <end>   5.66945345556266
<start> <start> " What does Mr . Darcy mean , " said she to Charlotte , " by listening to my 
 conversation with Colonel Forster ? " 
 
 " That is a question which Mr . Darcy only can answer . " 
 
 " But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see 
 what he is about . <end>   5.262848343335631
<start> <start> After a song 
 or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she 
 would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her 
 sister Mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in 
 the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always 
 impatient for display . <end>   4.9810452533961715
<start> <start> Mary had neither genius nor taste ; and though vanity had given her 
 application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited 
 manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she 
 had reached . <end>   3.89034918139434
<start> <start> Elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with 
 much more pleasure , though not playing half so well ; and Mary , at the 
 end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by 
 Scotch and Irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with 
 some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing 
 at one end of the room . <end>   4.945470684934867
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of 
 passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too 
 much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas 
 was his neighbour , till Sir William thus began . <end>   5.139677111711927
<start> <start> " What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr . Darcy ! - - There 
 is nothing like dancing after all . - - I consider it as one of the first 
 refinements of polished societies . " 
 
 " Certainly , Sir ; - - and it has the advantage also of being in vogue 
 amongst the less polished societies of the world . - - Every savage can 
 dance . " 
 
 Sir William only smiled . <end>   4.329643003661098
<start> <start> " Your friend performs delightfully ; " he 
 continued after a pause , on seeing Bingley join the group ; - - " and I doubt 
 not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Mr . Darcy . " 
 
 " You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Sir . " 
 
 " Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight . <end>   4.460035661570863
<start> <start> Do 
 you often dance at St . James 's ? " 
 
 " Never , sir . " 
 
 " Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " 
 
 " It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . " 
 
 " You have a house in town , I conclude ? " 
 
 Mr . Darcy bowed . <end>   4.518050783347389
<start> <start> " I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself - - for I am fond of 
 superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of 
 London would agree with Lady Lucas . " 
 
 He paused in hopes of an answer ; but his companion was not disposed to 
 make any ; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was 
 struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to 
 her , 
 
 " My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? - - Mr . Darcy , you must allow 
 me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . - - You 
 cannot refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . " 
 And taking her hand , he would have given it to Mr . Darcy , who , though 
 extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly 
 drew back , and said with some discomposure to Sir William , 
 
 " Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . - - I entreat you 
 not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . " 
 
 Mr . Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her 
 hand ; but in vain . <end>   5.244905674980521
<start> <start> " You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me 
 the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the 
 amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us 
 for one half hour . " 
 
 " Mr . Darcy is all politeness , " said Elizabeth , smiling . <end>   5.544817463385479
<start> <start> " He is indeed - - but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we 
 cannot wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a 
 partner ? " 
 
 Elizabeth looked archly , and turned away . <end>   4.632557837603566
<start> <start> I was never more annoyed ! <end>   3.5699856442926023
<start> <start> The insipidity and yet the noise ; the 
 nothingness and yet the self - importance of all these people ! - - What would 
 I give to hear your strictures on them ! " 
 
 " Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . <end>   3.736930970181168
<start> <start> My mind was more 
 agreeably engaged . <end>   5.93033230697093
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy replied with great intrepidity , 
 
 " Miss Elizabeth Bennet . " 
 
 " Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! " repeated Miss Bingley . <end>   4.677835390361179
<start> <start> " I am all astonishment . <end>   5.811972817345287
<start> <start> How long has she been such a favourite ? - - and pray when am I to wish you 
 joy ? " 
 
 " That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask . <end>   4.333610736937982
<start> <start> You will have a charming mother - in - law , indeed , and 
 of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . " 
 
 He listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to 
 entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her 
 that all was safe , her wit flowed long . <end>   6.067058584929576
<start> <start> She had a sister married to a Mr . Philips , who had been a clerk to their 
 father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in 
 London in a respectable line of trade . <end>   6.601315634568362
<start> <start> The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most 
 convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted 
 thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and 
 to a milliner 's shop just over the way . <end>   4.235283233117732
<start> <start> The two youngest of the family , 
 Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; 
 their minds were more vacant than their sisters ', and when nothing 
 better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning 
 hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news 
 the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some 
 from their aunt . <end>   4.382640017042251
<start> <start> At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with 
 news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the 
 neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the 
 head quarters . <end>   5.73701253693587
<start> <start> Every day added something to their knowledge of the 
 officers 'names and connections . <end>   4.429914061248805
<start> <start> They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Mr . 
 Bingley 's large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their 
 mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of 
 an ensign . <end>   5.083862709981139
<start> <start> After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Mr . 
 Bennet coolly observed , 
 
 " From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two 
 of the silliest girls in the country . <end>   4.890315694614279
<start> <start> " I am astonished , my dear , " said Mrs . <end>   3.7448127408553886
<start> <start> Bennet , " that you should be so 
 ready to think your own children silly . <end>   5.368689636309736
<start> <start> If I wished to think slightingly 
 of any body 's children , it should not be of my own however . " 
 
 " If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it . " 
 
 " Yes - - but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . " 
 
 " This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . <end>   5.633841642794714
<start> <start> I 
 had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must 
 so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly 
 foolish . " 
 
 " My dear Mr . Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of 
 their father and mother . - - When they get to our age I dare say they will 
 not think about officers any more than we do . <end>   4.4351888251900755
<start> <start> Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a 
 note for Miss Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited 
 for an answer . <end>   4.992839752944021
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet 's eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was 
 eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , 
 
 " Well , Jane , who is it from ? <end>   6.059347046269733
<start> <start> what is it about ? <end>   9.904721021142462
<start> <start> what does he say ? <end>   5.302849995966213
<start> <start> Well , 
 Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . " 
 
 " It is from Miss Bingley , " said Jane , and then read it aloud . <end>   5.256615186242786
<start> <start> " My dear Friend , 
 
 " If you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with Louisa and 
 me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our 
 lives , for a whole day 's tête - à - tête between two women can never 
 end without a quarrel . <end>   4.223550440443666
<start> <start> Come as soon as you can on the receipt of 
 this . <end>   7.751896273199597
<start> <start> My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . <end>   8.154209009369072
<start> <start> Yours ever , 
 
 " CAROLINE BINGLEY . " 
 
 " With the officers ! " cried Lydia . <end>   5.8523868439634175
<start> <start> " I wonder my aunt did not tell us of 
 _that_ . " 
 
 " Dining out , " said Mrs . <end>   5.370406573441532
<start> <start> Bennet , " that is very unlucky . " 
 
 " Can I have the carriage ? " said Jane . <end>   5.936529472225744
<start> <start> " No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to 
 rain ; and then you must stay all night . " 
 
 " That would be a good scheme , " said Elizabeth , " if you were sure that 
 they would not offer to send her home . " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   5.047049013418342
<start> <start> They are 
 wanted in the farm , Mr . Bennet , are not they ? " 
 
 " They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . " 
 
 " But if you have got them to - day , " said Elizabeth , " my mother 's purpose 
 will be answered . " 
 
 She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses 
 were engaged . <end>   4.582862924856541
<start> <start> Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her 
 mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad 
 day . <end>   5.278317198930664
<start> <start> Her hopes were answered ; Jane had not been gone long before it 
 rained hard . <end>   3.4680976209324244
<start> <start> The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; 
 Jane certainly could not come back . <end>   5.723757136444681
<start> <start> " This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! " said Mrs . <end>   5.821827279182027
<start> <start> Bennet , more than 
 once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own . <end>   6.617299265435617
<start> <start> Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield 
 brought the following note for Elizabeth : 
 
 " My dearest Lizzy , 
 
 " I FIND myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be 
 imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . <end>   4.291816466417296
<start> <start> My kind friends will 
 not hear of my returning home till I am better . <end>   5.23287210611342
<start> <start> They insist also on 
 my seeing Mr . Jones - - therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear 
 of his having been to me - - and excepting a sore - throat and head - ache 
 there is not much the matter with me . <end>   5.063948111744666
<start> <start> " Yours , & c . " 
 
 " Well , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet , when Elizabeth had read the note 
 aloud , " if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she 
 should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of 
 Mr . Bingley , and under your orders . " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   3.9788333728499174
<start> <start> I am not at all afraid of her dying . <end>   7.217636407946422
<start> <start> People do not die of little 
 trifling colds . <end>   5.3117342965939605
<start> <start> She will be taken good care of . <end>   5.495134534105422
<start> <start> As long as she stays 
 there , it is all very well . <end>   6.736845710243011
<start> <start> " How can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a 
 thing , in all this dirt ! <end>   6.1180740133970115
<start> <start> You will not be fit to be seen when you get 
 there . " 
 
 " I shall be very fit to see Jane - - which is all I want . " 
 
 " Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the 
 horses ? " 
 
 " No , indeed . <end>   5.206951959900303
<start> <start> I do not wish to avoid the walk . <end>   5.698277752601358
<start> <start> The distance is nothing , 
 when one has a motive ; only three miles . <end>   4.4020411059549165
<start> <start> I shall be back by dinner . " 
 
 " I admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed Mary , " but every 
 impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , 
 exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . " 
 
 " We will go as far as Meryton with you , " said Catherine and 
 Lydia . - - Elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set 
 off together . <end>   4.505645147816058
<start> <start> " If we make haste , " said Lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may 
 see something of Captain Carter before he goes . " 
 
 In Meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one 
 of the officers 'wives , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing 
 field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing 
 over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within 
 view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face 
 glowing with the warmth of exercise . <end>   3.5100941142385005
<start> <start> She was shewn into the breakfast - parlour , where all but Jane were 
 assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of 
 surprise . - - That she should have walked three miles so early in the day , 
 in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to Mrs . <end>   5.198826121167376
<start> <start> She was received , however , very politely by them ; 
 and in their brother 's manners there was something better than 
 politeness ; there was good humour and kindness . - - Mr . Darcy said very 
 little , and Mr . Hurst nothing at all . <end>   5.207172837713465
<start> <start> The former was divided between 
 admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , 
 and doubt as to the occasion 's justifying her coming so far alone . <end>   4.322033537117205
<start> <start> The 
 latter was thinking only of his breakfast . <end>   4.4799445271474365
<start> <start> Miss 
 Bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well 
 enough to leave her room . <end>   6.457399191152376
<start> <start> Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her 
 immediately ; and Jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving 
 alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed 
 for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . <end>   5.579836633773894
<start> <start> She was not equal , 
 however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , 
 could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the 
 extraordinary kindness she was treated with . <end>   6.049436631052641
<start> <start> Elizabeth silently attended 
 her . <end>   6.253813190579586
<start> <start> When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters ; and Elizabeth 
 began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and 
 solicitude they shewed for Jane . <end>   5.508384179521143
<start> <start> Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were 
 the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had in fact 
 nothing to do elsewhere . <end>   5.557905190081866
<start> <start> When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt that she must go ; and very 
 unwillingly said so . <end>   5.243569491752421
<start> <start> Elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was 
 dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring 
 back a supply of clothes . <end>   4.626680556414661
<start> <start> CHAPTER VIII . 
 
 
 At five o 'clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six 
 Elizabeth was summoned to dinner . <end>   3.7772290153248798
<start> <start> To the civil enquiries which then 
 poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the 
 much superior solicitude of Mr . Bingley 's , she could not make a very 
 favourable answer . <end>   4.6863900766977284
<start> <start> The sisters , on hearing 
 this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how 
 shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked 
 being ill themselves ; and then thought no more of the matter : and their 
 indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them , restored 
 Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . <end>   4.699161013497698
<start> <start> She had very little notice from any but him . <end>   3.7034006622093414
<start> <start> When dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley 
 began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . <end>   6.25208216669607
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Hurst 
 thought the same , and added , 
 
 " She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent 
 walker . <end>   7.365018943950766
<start> <start> I shall never forget her appearance this morning . <end>   3.299354414832305
<start> <start> She really 
 looked almost wild . " 
 
 " She did indeed , Louisa . <end>   4.047549602089466
<start> <start> Very 
 nonsensical to come at all ! <end>   6.0512980124858045
<start> <start> Why must _she_ be scampering about the 
 country , because her sister had a cold ? <end>   5.809006742018807
<start> <start> I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably 
 well , when she came into the room this morning . <end>   5.032200584112875
<start> <start> Her dirty petticoat 
 quite escaped my notice . " 
 
 " _You_ observed it , Mr . Darcy , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley ; " and I am 
 inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such 
 an exhibition . " 
 
 " Certainly not . " 
 
 " To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , 
 above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! <end>   4.2789599171545705
<start> <start> what could she mean by 
 it ? <end>   9.64960767535197
<start> <start> It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , 
 a most country town indifference to decorum . " 
 
 " It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said 
 Bingley . <end>   5.059469597645492
<start> <start> " I am afraid , Mr . Darcy , " observed Miss Bingley , in a half whisper , 
 " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine 
 eyes . " 
 
 " Not at all , " he replied ; " they were brightened by the exercise . " - - A 
 short pause followed this speech , and Mrs . <end>   4.804044857293902
<start> <start> Hurst began again . <end>   6.0297858545623955
<start> <start> " If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside , " cried Bingley , " it 
 would not make them one jot less agreeable . " 
 
 " But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any 
 consideration in the world , " replied Darcy . <end>   4.328300686502028
<start> <start> With a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on 
 leaving the dining - parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . <end>   5.301444636414891
<start> <start> She was still very poorly , and Elizabeth would not quit her at all , till 
 late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and 
 when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go 
 down stairs herself . <end>   5.567663039134216
<start> <start> On entering the drawing - room she found the whole 
 party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them ; but suspecting 
 them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the 
 excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay 
 below with a book . <end>   5.559015903369854
<start> <start> Mr . Hurst looked at her with astonishment . <end>   4.540096057618384
<start> <start> She is a great 
 reader and has no pleasure in anything else . " 
 
 " I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried Elizabeth ; " I am 
 _not_ a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . " 
 
 " In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , " said Bingley ; " and 
 I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . " 
 
 Elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table 
 where a few books were lying . <end>   4.468604438788219
<start> <start> He immediately offered to fetch her 
 others ; all that his library afforded . <end>   5.63799186148352
<start> <start> " And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own 
 credit ; but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more 
 than I ever look into . " 
 
 Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those 
 in the room . <end>   4.6388155104436795
<start> <start> " I am astonished , " said Miss Bingley , " that my father should have left 
 so small a collection of books . - - What a delightful library you have at 
 Pemberley , Mr . Darcy ! " 
 
 " It ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many 
 generations . " 
 
 " And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying 
 books . " 
 
 " I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as 
 these . " 
 
 " Neglect ! <end>   4.760842359708917
<start> <start> I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of 
 that noble place . <end>   4.0602967304561
<start> <start> Charles , when you build _your_ house , I wish it may be 
 half as delightful as Pemberley . " 
 
 " I wish it may . " 
 
 " But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that 
 neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . <end>   4.876752865983766
<start> <start> There is not a 
 finer county in England than Derbyshire . " 
 
 " With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it . " 
 
 " I am talking of possibilities , Charles . " 
 
 " Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get 
 Pemberley by purchase than by imitation . " 
 
 Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little 
 attention for her book ; and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near 
 the card - table , and stationed herself between Mr . Bingley and his eldest 
 sister , to observe the game . <end>   4.192235821084945
<start> <start> " Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? " said Miss Bingley ; " will 
 she be as tall as I am ? " 
 
 " I think she will . <end>   5.6499541780128535
<start> <start> She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet 's height , or 
 rather taller . " 
 
 " How I long to see her again ! <end>   3.875428906784062
<start> <start> I never met with anybody who delighted me 
 so much . <end>   4.169343409839642
<start> <start> They all paint tables , cover skreens and net 
 purses . <end>   2.191553721439098
<start> <start> I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and I am sure I 
 never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being 
 informed that she was very accomplished . " 
 
 " Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said Darcy , " has 
 too much truth . <end>   5.1672377261047
<start> <start> The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no 
 otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen . <end>   3.0825306738548224
<start> <start> I 
 cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my 
 acquaintance , that are really accomplished . " 
 
 " Nor I , I am sure , " said Miss Bingley . <end>   4.724726694880323
<start> <start> " Then , " observed Elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your 
 idea of an accomplished woman . " 
 
 " Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   4.653746264296016
<start> <start> certainly , " cried his faithful assistant , " no one can be really 
 esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met 
 with . <end>   5.2654701288289925
<start> <start> A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , 
 dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all 
 this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of 
 walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word 
 will be but half deserved . " 
 
 " All this she must possess , " added Darcy , " and to all this she must yet 
 add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by 
 extensive reading . " 
 
 " I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women . <end>   4.517756865394085
<start> <start> I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_ . " 
 
 " Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all 
 this ? " 
 
 " _I_ never saw such a woman . <end>   4.153414585868401
<start> <start> _I_ never saw such capacity , and taste , and 
 application , and elegance , as you describe , united . " 
 
 Mrs . <end>   5.970694258566965
<start> <start> Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her 
 implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who 
 answered this description , when Mr . Hurst called them to order , with 
 bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward . <end>   4.0190755750711125
<start> <start> " Eliza Bennet , " said Miss Bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is 
 one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other 
 sex , by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it 
 succeeds . <end>   5.745511322863694
<start> <start> But , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art . " 
 
 " Undoubtedly , " replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , 
 " there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend 
 to employ for captivation . <end>   4.1930981968360035
<start> <start> Whatever bears affinity to cunning is 
 despicable . " 
 
 Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to 
 continue the subject . <end>   4.527378965296975
<start> <start> Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and 
 that she could not leave her . <end>   8.4834917628332
<start> <start> Bingley urged Mr . Jones 's being sent for 
 immediately ; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could 
 be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most 
 eminent physicians . <end>   4.121603001648412
<start> <start> This , she would not hear of ; but she was not so 
 unwilling to comply with their brother 's proposal ; and it was settled 
 that Mr . Jones should be sent for early in the morning , if Miss Bennet 
 were not decidedly better . <end>   6.467388008832487
<start> <start> They solaced their wretchedness , 
 however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to 
 his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every 
 possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister . <end>   4.249369922619182
<start> <start> CHAPTER IX . 
 
 
 Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister 's room , and in the 
 morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the 
 enquiries which she very early received from Mr . Bingley by a housemaid , 
 and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his 
 sisters . <end>   5.7811410959171985
<start> <start> In spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a 
 note sent to Longbourn , desiring her mother to visit Jane , and form her 
 own judgment of her situation . <end>   6.711755341219929
<start> <start> The note was immediately dispatched , and 
 its contents as quickly complied with . <end>   3.4733671863219118
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet , accompanied by her 
 two youngest girls , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast . <end>   5.8357743924210395
<start> <start> Bennet would have been 
 very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was 
 not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her 
 restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield . <end>   5.240872162735726
<start> <start> She 
 would not listen therefore to her daughter 's proposal of being carried 
 home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think 
 it at all advisable . <end>   5.150085508581054
<start> <start> Bingley met them with hopes 
 that Mrs . <end>   5.402493711118793
<start> <start> " Indeed I have , Sir , " was her answer . <end>   6.515928047387197
<start> <start> " She is a great deal too ill to be 
 moved . <end>   4.412253038683634
<start> <start> Mr . Jones says we must not think of moving her . <end>   4.816281687592687
<start> <start> " It must not be thought of . <end>   8.21934869370048
<start> <start> Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments . <end>   5.031607486408121
<start> <start> I often tell my other girls they are nothing to 
 _her_ . <end>   5.599801246307128
<start> <start> You have a sweet room here , Mr . Bingley , and a charming prospect 
 over that gravel walk . <end>   4.341913449763601
<start> <start> I do not know a place in the country that is 
 equal to Netherfield . <end>   6.628737409245235
<start> <start> You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I 
 hope , though you have but a short lease . " 
 
 " Whatever I do is done in a hurry , " replied he ; " and therefore if I 
 should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five 
 minutes . <end>   4.933515070952698
<start> <start> At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . " 
 
 " That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , " said Elizabeth . <end>   4.102547539031123
<start> <start> " Oh ! <end>   4.2396923682408225
<start> <start> yes - - I understand you perfectly . " 
 
 " I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen 
 through I am afraid is pitiful . " 
 
 " That is as it happens . <end>   4.415675145587169
<start> <start> It does not necessarily follow that a deep , 
 intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . " 
 
 " Lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in 
 the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . " 
 
 " I did not know before , " continued Bingley immediately , " that you were a 
 studier of character . <end>   4.73450474152281
<start> <start> They have at 
 least that advantage . " 
 
 " The country , " said Darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for 
 such a study . <end>   4.427350317843194
<start> <start> In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined 
 and unvarying society . " 
 
 " But people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be 
 observed in them for ever . " 
 
 " Yes , indeed , " cried Mrs . <end>   3.5321215582868555
<start> <start> Bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a 
 country neighbourhood . <end>   6.072195232501096
<start> <start> " I assure you there is quite as much of _that_ 
 going on in the country as in town . " 
 
 Every body was surprised ; and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , 
 turned silently away . <end>   6.483221875190175
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete 
 victory over him , continued her triumph . <end>   4.02525117934133
<start> <start> " I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for 
 my part , except the shops and public places . <end>   2.932721412468131
<start> <start> The country is a vast deal 
 pleasanter , is not it , Mr . Bingley ? " 
 
 " When I am in the country , " he replied , " I never wish to leave it ; and 
 when I am in town it is pretty much the same . <end>   6.043318113633326
<start> <start> They have each their 
 advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . " 
 
 " Aye - - that is because you have the right disposition . <end>   5.6412101514707205
<start> <start> But that 
 gentleman , " looking at Darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing 
 at all . " 
 
 " Indeed , Mama , you are mistaken , " said Elizabeth , blushing for her 
 mother . <end>   6.397790629838711
<start> <start> " You quite mistook Mr . Darcy . <end>   4.519616134197868
<start> <start> He only meant that there were not 
 such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which 
 you must acknowledge to be true . " 
 
 " Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with 
 many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few 
 neighbourhoods larger . <end>   5.835308400625331
<start> <start> I know we dine with four and twenty families . " 
 
 Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his 
 countenance . <end>   3.60451440199025
<start> <start> His sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards 
 Mr . Darcy with a very expressive smile . <end>   4.948103067657276
<start> <start> Elizabeth , for the sake of 
 saying something that might turn her mother 's thoughts , now asked her if 
 Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away . <end>   4.386593682793665
<start> <start> " Yes , she called yesterday with her father . <end>   8.79734522192573
<start> <start> What an agreeable man Sir 
 William is , Mr . Bingley - - is not he ? <end>   5.590277865212228
<start> <start> so much the man of fashion ! <end>   10.046418284247013
<start> <start> so 
 genteel and so easy ! - - He has always something to say to every 
 body . - - _That_ is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy 
 themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the 
 matter . " 
 
 " Did Charlotte dine with you ? " 
 
 " No , she would go home . <end>   4.458976061693355
<start> <start> I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies . <end>   4.719608933681455
<start> <start> For 
 my part , Mr . Bingley , _I_ always keep servants that can do their own 
 work ; _my_ daughters are brought up differently . <end>   2.9115140416167993
<start> <start> It is a pity they are not handsome ! <end>   4.536465114785812
<start> <start> Not that _I_ think 
 Charlotte so _very_ plain - - but then she is our particular friend . " 
 
 " She seems a very pleasant young woman , " said Bingley . <end>   4.088147086168572
<start> <start> " Oh ! <end>   4.2396923682408225
<start> <start> dear , yes ; - - but you must own she is very plain . <end>   7.323233466359379
<start> <start> Lady Lucas herself 
 has often said so , and envied me Jane 's beauty . <end>   5.3614722676971756
<start> <start> I do not like to boast 
 of my own child , but to be sure , Jane - - one does not often see any body 
 better looking . <end>   5.6790477899298635
<start> <start> It is what every body says . <end>   5.2490867931099645
<start> <start> I do not trust my own 
 partiality . <end>   6.650950749460206
<start> <start> When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my 
 brother Gardiner 's in town , so much in love with her , that my 
 sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . <end>   4.522343831553867
<start> <start> But however he did not . <end>   5.6617148917590985
<start> <start> However , he 
 wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were . " 
 
 " And so ended his affection , " said Elizabeth impatiently . <end>   5.563559111696264
<start> <start> " Of a fine , stout , healthy love it may . <end>   3.1562205212239576
<start> <start> Every thing nourishes what is 
 strong already . <end>   4.159222221333908
<start> <start> But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I 
 am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . " 
 
 Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth 
 tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again . <end>   3.7192544798922316
<start> <start> Bennet was satisfied , and 
 soon afterwards ordered her carriage . <end>   6.707062307591869
<start> <start> Upon this signal , the youngest of 
 her daughters put herself forward . <end>   5.38715528128705
<start> <start> Lydia was a stout , well - grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion 
 and good - humoured countenance ; a favourite with her mother , whose 
 affection had brought her into public at an early age . <end>   3.7579169094434164
<start> <start> She had high 
 animal spirits , and a sort of natural self - consequence , which the 
 attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle 's good dinners and her own 
 easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance . <end>   5.17353986166324
<start> <start> She was very 
 equal therefore to address Mr . Bingley on the subject of the ball , and 
 abruptly reminded him of his promise ; adding , that it would be the most 
 shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it . <end>   5.4734552416987095
<start> <start> His answer to this 
 sudden attack was delightful to their mother 's ear . <end>   3.977071695387766
<start> <start> But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill . " 
 
 Lydia declared herself satisfied . <end>   5.110143156744159
<start> <start> " Oh ! <end>   4.2396923682408225
<start> <start> And when you have given _your_ ball , " she 
 added , " I shall insist on their giving one also . <end>   6.380464404657965
<start> <start> I shall tell Colonel 
 Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . " 
 
 Mrs . <end>   4.103638836520681
<start> <start> Bennet and her daughters then departed , and Elizabeth returned 
 instantly to Jane , leaving her own and her relations 'behaviour to the 
 remarks of the two ladies and Mr . Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , 
 could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_ , in spite of 
 all Miss Bingley 's witticisms on _fine eyes_ . <end>   5.251775477665639
<start> <start> CHAPTER X . 
 
 
 The day passed much as the day before had done . <end>   6.295182857544453
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Hurst and Miss 
 Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who 
 continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening Elizabeth joined 
 their party in the drawing - room . <end>   5.478665669884358
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near him , was watching 
 the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by 
 messages to his sister . <end>   5.294787877554747
<start> <start> Mr . Hurst and Mr . Bingley were at piquet , and 
 Mrs . <end>   6.244681077336441
<start> <start> Hurst was observing their game . <end>   3.518029935561936
<start> <start> Elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in 
 attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion . <end>   5.0540653865705725
<start> <start> The perpetual 
 commendations of the lady either on his hand - writing , or on the evenness 
 of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern 
 with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was 
 exactly in unison with her opinion of each . <end>   5.141393810970001
<start> <start> " How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! " 
 
 He made no answer . <end>   6.138522547942463
<start> <start> I write rather slowly . " 
 
 " How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the 
 year ! <end>   4.138100113546795
<start> <start> Letters of business too ! <end>   5.034137463649789
<start> <start> How odious I should think them ! " 
 
 " It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . " 
 
 " Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . " 
 
 " I have already told her so once , by your desire . " 
 
 " I am afraid you do not like your pen . <end>   3.7967826428755247
<start> <start> Let me mend it for you . <end>   4.013558849897461
<start> <start> I mend 
 pens remarkably well . " 
 
 " Thank you - - but I always mend my own . " 
 
 " How can you contrive to write so even ? " 
 
 He was silent . <end>   3.5469165775123934
<start> <start> " Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , 
 and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful 
 little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss 
 Grantley 's . " 
 
 " Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? - - At 
 present I have not room to do them justice . " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   4.383569730617106
<start> <start> it is of no consequence . <end>   7.421697212283702
<start> <start> I shall see her in January . <end>   6.657816344324464
<start> <start> But do you 
 always write such charming long letters to her , Mr . Darcy ? " 
 
 " They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me 
 to determine . " 
 
 " It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with 
 ease , cannot write ill . " 
 
 " That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , " cried her 
 brother - - " because he does _not_ write with ease . <end>   4.4699559872075
<start> <start> He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . " 
 
 " My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them - - by which 
 means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents . " 
 
 " Your humility , Mr . Bingley , " said Elizabeth , " must disarm reproof . " 
 
 " Nothing is more deceitful , " said Darcy , " than the appearance of 
 humility . <end>   3.8146566577024426
<start> <start> It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an 
 indirect boast . " 
 
 " And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty ? " 
 
 " The indirect boast ; - - for you are really proud of your defects in 
 writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of 
 thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think 
 at least highly interesting . <end>   4.1701837487325815
<start> <start> The power of doing any thing with 
 quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any 
 attention to the imperfection of the performance . <end>   6.009132217914065
<start> <start> When you told Mrs . <end>   5.314668109171986
<start> <start> Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield 
 you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of 
 panegyric , of compliment to yourself - - and yet what is there so very 
 laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business 
 undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? " 
 
 " Nay , " cried Bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the 
 foolish things that were said in the morning . <end>   5.446920213829969
<start> <start> And yet , upon my honour , I 
 believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this 
 moment . <end>   7.489188207148647
<start> <start> At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless 
 precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . " 
 
 " I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you 
 would be gone with such celerity . <end>   4.108983439879609
<start> <start> Your conduct would be quite as 
 dependant on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were 
 mounting your horse , a friend were to say , 'Bingley , you had better stay 
 till next week ,' you would probably do it , you would probably not 
 go - - and , at another word , might stay a month . " 
 
 " You have only proved by this , " cried Elizabeth , " that Mr . Bingley did 
 not do justice to his own disposition . <end>   4.998630266389232
<start> <start> You have shewn him off now much 
 more than he did himself . " 
 
 " I am exceedingly gratified , " said Bingley , " by your converting what my 
 friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . <end>   4.51189900194622
<start> <start> But I am 
 afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means 
 intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a 
 circumstance I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I 
 could . " 
 
 " Would Mr . Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention 
 as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? " 
 
 " Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter , Darcy must speak for 
 himself . " 
 
 " You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but 
 which I have never acknowledged . <end>   3.840707293979643
<start> <start> Allowing the case , however , to stand 
 according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that 
 the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the 
 delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one 
 argument in favour of its propriety . " 
 
 " To yield readily - - easily - - to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit 
 with you . " 
 
 " To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of 
 either . " 
 
 " You appear to me , Mr . Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of 
 friendship and affection . <end>   4.644172257327117
<start> <start> We may as well wait , perhaps , till the 
 circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour 
 thereupon . <end>   4.637717421223985
<start> <start> But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , 
 where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no 
 very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying 
 with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? " 
 
 " Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange 
 with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to 
 appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting 
 between the parties ? " 
 
 " By all means , " cried Bingley ; " let us hear all the particulars , not 
 forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more 
 weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . <end>   4.43152423659739
<start> <start> I assure 
 you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with 
 myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . <end>   6.679595167968622
<start> <start> I declare I do not 
 know a more aweful object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in 
 particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening 
 when he has nothing to do . " 
 
 Mr . Darcy smiled ; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was 
 rather offended ; and therefore checked her laugh . <end>   5.299115815518434
<start> <start> Arguments are too much like disputes . <end>   5.731952603870404
<start> <start> If you and Miss 
 Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very 
 thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . " 
 
 " What you ask , " said Elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr . 
 Darcy had much better finish his letter . " 
 
 Mr . Darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter . <end>   4.580250146223676
<start> <start> When that business was over , he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth 
 for the indulgence of some music . <end>   7.364803584905232
<start> <start> Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to 
 the piano - forte , and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead 
 the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she 
 seated herself . <end>   4.580280878451114
<start> <start> Hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed 
 Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books 
 that lay on the instrument , how frequently Mr . Darcy 's eyes were fixed 
 on her . <end>   4.8080233313545575
<start> <start> She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of 
 admiration to so great a man ; and yet that he should look at her because 
 he disliked her , was still more strange . <end>   6.200954841654049
<start> <start> She could only imagine however 
 at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about 
 her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than 
 in any other person present . <end>   4.128059562412203
<start> <start> The supposition did not pain her . <end>   5.475514625938255
<start> <start> He repeated the question , with some 
 surprise at her silence . <end>   6.9851933796862395
<start> <start> " Oh ! " said she , " I heard you before ; but I could not immediately 
 determine what to say in reply . <end>   6.552884523075764
<start> <start> You wanted me , I know , to say 'Yes ,' 
 that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but I always 
 delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of 
 their premeditated contempt . <end>   5.319199180038702
<start> <start> He really 
 believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he 
 should be in some danger . <end>   8.63891159897513
<start> <start> Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great 
 anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane , received some 
 assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth . <end>   6.377837335454954
<start> <start> She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of 
 their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . <end>   4.339705110900081
<start> <start> " I hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the 
 next day , " you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this 
 desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; 
 and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after 
 the officers . - - And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to 
 check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , 
 which your lady possesses . " 
 
 " Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   4.068736916278098
<start> <start> Put them next to your great uncle 
 the judge . <end>   5.198846963406409
<start> <start> They are in the same profession , you know ; only in different 
 lines . <end>   4.524537912517885
<start> <start> As for your Elizabeth 's picture , you must not attempt to have it 
 taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? " 
 
 " It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their 
 colour and shape , and the eye - lashes , so remarkably fine , might be 
 copied . " 
 
 At that moment they were met from another walk , by Mrs . <end>   4.7442980630206435
<start> <start> Hurst and 
 Elizabeth herself . <end>   9.004222958023957
<start> <start> " I did not know that you intended to walk , " said Miss Bingley , in some 
 confusion , lest they had been overheard . <end>   7.211845153342803
<start> <start> " You used us abominably ill , " answered Mrs . <end>   4.571352299410875
<start> <start> The path just admitted three . <end>   3.357834756476033
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy felt their rudeness 
 and immediately said , - - 
 
 " This walk is not wide enough for our party . <end>   5.034920879995978
<start> <start> We had better go into the 
 avenue . " 
 
 But Elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , 
 laughingly answered , 
 
 " No , no ; stay where you are . - - You are charmingly group 'd , and appear to 
 uncommon advantage . <end>   4.976783932634238
<start> <start> The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a 
 fourth . <end>   4.781067975632143
<start> <start> Good bye . " 
 
 She then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of 
 being at home again in a day or two . <end>   4.689349169387024
<start> <start> Jane was already so much recovered 
 as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening . <end>   3.6976178582821477
<start> <start> CHAPTER XI . 
 
 
 When the ladies removed after dinner , Elizabeth ran up to her sister , 
 and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the 
 drawing - room ; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many 
 professions of pleasure ; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable 
 as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . <end>   4.521555033622326
<start> <start> Their powers of conversation were considerable . <end>   3.384195651281527
<start> <start> They could describe an 
 entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh 
 at their acquaintance with spirit . <end>   3.369858358393601
<start> <start> But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object . <end>   6.945158492687932
<start> <start> Miss Bingley 's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy , and she had 
 something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . <end>   5.921903921248395
<start> <start> He was full of joy and 
 attention . <end>   5.157057040676888
<start> <start> The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she 
 should suffer from the change of room ; and she removed at his desire to 
 the other side of the fire - place , that she might be farther from the 
 door . <end>   4.657891547026799
<start> <start> He then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else . <end>   6.044618694958342
<start> <start> Elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great 
 delight . <end>   5.63589750490161
<start> <start> When tea was over , Mr . Hurst reminded his sister - in - law of the 
 card - table - - but in vain . <end>   4.021807338713255
<start> <start> She had obtained private intelligence that Mr . 
 Darcy did not wish for cards ; and Mr . Hurst soon found even his open 
 petition rejected . <end>   3.76544287988258
<start> <start> She assured him that no one intended to play , and the 
 silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her . <end>   6.421714524956367
<start> <start> Mr . 
 Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the 
 sophas and go to sleep . <end>   4.082108054464164
<start> <start> Darcy took up a book ; Miss Bingley did the same ; 
 and Mrs . <end>   5.6636962810306235
<start> <start> Miss Bingley 's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr . 
 Darcy 's progress through _his_ book , as in reading her own ; and she was 
 perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . <end>   4.67855718589724
<start> <start> She 
 could not win him , however , to any conversation ; he merely answered her 
 question , and read on . <end>   6.963232570251303
<start> <start> At length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be 
 amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the 
 second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " How pleasant it 
 is to spend an evening in this way ! <end>   6.959914238768462
<start> <start> I declare after all there is no 
 enjoyment like reading ! <end>   4.754850647854273
<start> <start> How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a 
 book ! - - When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not 
 an excellent library . " 
 
 No one made any reply . <end>   5.330985564094223
<start> <start> She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and 
 cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement ; when hearing 
 her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet , she turned suddenly 
 towards him and said , 
 
 " By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at 
 Netherfield ? - - I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult 
 the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not 
 some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a 
 pleasure . " 
 
 " If you mean Darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , 
 before it begins - - but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and 
 as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my 
 cards . " 
 
 " I should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were 
 carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably 
 tedious in the usual process of such a meeting . <end>   5.1106668273541285
<start> <start> It would surely be much 
 more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the 
 day . " 
 
 " Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be 
 near so much like a ball . " 
 
 Miss Bingley made no answer ; and soon afterwards got up and walked about 
 the room . <end>   4.65251899073077
<start> <start> Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; - - but Darcy , at 
 whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious . <end>   6.681883049936774
<start> <start> In the desperation 
 of her feelings she resolved on one effort more ; and , turning to 
 Elizabeth , said , 
 
 " Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a 
 turn about the room . - - I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting 
 so long in one attitude . " 
 
 Elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . <end>   5.510030542385249
<start> <start> Miss Bingley 
 succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; Mr . Darcy looked 
 up . <end>   5.789724472870194
<start> <start> He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as 
 Elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book . <end>   5.716294360478252
<start> <start> He was 
 directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , 
 that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and 
 down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them 
 would interfere . <end>   5.110450024054455
<start> <start> " What could he mean ? <end>   5.562766927804369
<start> <start> " Not at all , " was her answer ; " but depend upon it , he means to be severe 
 on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing 
 about it . " 
 
 Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Mr . Darcy in any 
 thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two 
 motives . <end>   5.983413820345014
<start> <start> " I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon 
 as she allowed him to speak . <end>   4.95453156356586
<start> <start> shocking ! " cried Miss Bingley . <end>   9.92691713881322
<start> <start> How shall we punish him for such a speech ? " 
 
 " Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said Elizabeth . <end>   4.328440154627951
<start> <start> " We 
 can all plague and punish one another . <end>   2.986430938010399
<start> <start> Teaze him - - laugh at 
 him . - - Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done . " 
 
 " But upon my honour I do _not_ . <end>   7.030651347487121
<start> <start> I do assure you that my intimacy has not 
 yet taught me _that_ . <end>   4.55611087786725
<start> <start> No , 
 no - - I feel he may defy us there . <end>   7.910052006270458
<start> <start> And as to laughter , we will not expose 
 ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . <end>   5.044806808373743
<start> <start> " That is an 
 uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would 
 be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance . <end>   5.970315069503987
<start> <start> I dearly love a 
 laugh . " 
 
 " Miss Bingley , " said he , " has given me credit for more than can be . <end>   4.789959337759042
<start> <start> The 
 wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , 
 may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a 
 joke . " 
 
 " Certainly , " replied Elizabeth - - " there are such people , but I hope I am 
 not one of _them_ . <end>   5.425024509543682
<start> <start> I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good . <end>   4.809573645193366
<start> <start> Follies 
 and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me , I own , and I 
 laugh at them whenever I can . - - But these , I suppose , are precisely what 
 you are without . " 
 
 " Perhaps that is not possible for any one . <end>   4.843483986453905
<start> <start> But it has been the study of 
 my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong 
 understanding to ridicule . " 
 
 " Such as vanity and pride . " 
 
 " Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . <end>   3.108824078402068
<start> <start> " Your examination of Mr . Darcy is over , I presume , " said Miss 
 Bingley ; - - " and pray what is the result ? " 
 
 " I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr . Darcy has no defect . <end>   4.9332859009403425
<start> <start> He owns it 
 himself without disguise . " 
 
 " No " - - said Darcy , " I have made no such pretension . <end>   6.02994540631735
<start> <start> I have faults enough , 
 but they are not , I hope , of understanding . <end>   7.989912952485912
<start> <start> I cannot forget the follies and vices of 
 others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself . <end>   4.3848315768373
<start> <start> My 
 feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them . <end>   3.6095096946978114
<start> <start> My temper 
 would perhaps be called resentful . - - My good opinion once lost is lost 
 for ever . " 
 
 " _That_ is a failing indeed ! " - - cried Elizabeth . <end>   4.240168070751119
<start> <start> But you have chosen your fault well . - - I 
 really cannot _laugh_ at it . <end>   3.890142006602443
<start> <start> He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention . <end>   4.702800318504993
<start> <start> CHAPTER XII . 
 
 
 In consequence of an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the 
 next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for 
 them in the course of the day . <end>   7.341896674941815
<start> <start> But Mrs . <end>   6.902327267283384
<start> <start> Bennet , who had calculated on 
 her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday , which 
 would exactly finish Jane 's week , could not bring herself to receive 
 them with pleasure before . <end>   4.973726801879481
<start> <start> Her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at 
 least not to Elizabeth 's wishes , for she was impatient to get home . <end>   8.162161237882808
<start> <start> Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage 
 before Tuesday ; and in her postscript it was added , that if Mr . Bingley 
 and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very 
 well . - - Against staying longer , however , Elizabeth was positively 
 resolved - - nor did she much expect it would be asked ; and fearful , on the 
 contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , 
 she urged Jane to borrow Mr . Bingley 's carriage immediately , and at 
 length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield 
 that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . <end>   5.544804087973731
<start> <start> The communication excited many professions of concern ; and enough was 
 said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on 
 Jane ; and till the morrow , their going was deferred . <end>   5.104557188908994
<start> <start> Miss Bingley was 
 then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike 
 of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . <end>   5.298880298783006
<start> <start> To Mr . Darcy it was welcome intelligence - - Elizabeth had been at 
 Netherfield long enough . <end>   6.873175786953323
<start> <start> She attracted him more than he liked - - and Miss 
 Bingley was uncivil to _her_ , and more teazing than usual to himself . <end>   5.2485926520657955
<start> <start> Steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke 
 ten words to her through the whole of Saturday , and though they were at 
 one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most 
 conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her . <end>   5.013814418562841
<start> <start> On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost 
 all , took place . <end>   5.766515477750804
<start> <start> Miss Bingley 's civility to Elizabeth increased at last 
 very rapidly , as well as her affection for Jane ; and when they parted , 
 after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to 
 see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield , and embracing her most 
 tenderly , she even shook hands with the former . - - Elizabeth took leave of 
 the whole party in the liveliest spirits . <end>   6.082851446128436
<start> <start> They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother . <end>   2.962305352996736
<start> <start> The 
 evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its 
 animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of Jane and 
 Elizabeth . <end>   5.4451809200168215
<start> <start> They found Mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human 
 nature ; and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations 
 of thread - bare morality to listen to . <end>   4.066997768847541
<start> <start> Catherine and Lydia had 
 information for them of a different sort . <end>   7.255035666029088
<start> <start> Much had been done , and much 
 had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday ; several of 
 the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been 
 flogged , and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going 
 to be married . <end>   5.82779159295575
<start> <start> CHAPTER XIII . 
 
 
 " I hope , my dear , " said Mr . Bennet to his wife , as they were at 
 breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to - day , 
 because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . " 
 
 " Who do you mean , my dear ? <end>   5.113401194394278
<start> <start> I do not believe she often sees such at home . " 
 
 " The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . " Mrs . <end>   4.551111661865463
<start> <start> It is Mr . Bingley 
 I am sure . <end>   6.2925430545976155
<start> <start> Why Jane - - you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing ! <end>   4.60335353218301
<start> <start> Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr . Bingley . - - But - - good 
 lord ! <end>   6.262961093258621
<start> <start> how unlucky ! <end>   8.522927231207714
<start> <start> Lydia , 
 my love , ring the bell . <end>   9.055732363405442
<start> <start> I must speak to Hill , this moment . " 
 
 " It is _not_ Mr . Bingley , " said her husband ; " it is a person whom I 
 never saw in the whole course of my life . " 
 
 This roused a general astonishment ; and he had the pleasure of being 
 eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once . <end>   5.054928868110637
<start> <start> It is from my cousin , Mr . Collins , who , when I am dead , 
 may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   5.0694451267334815
<start> <start> my dear , " cried his wife , " I cannot bear to hear that mentioned . <end>   4.8155091716602305
<start> <start> Pray do not talk of that odious man . <end>   7.736162745766535
<start> <start> I do think it is the hardest thing 
 in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own 
 children ; and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago 
 to do something or other about it . " 
 
 Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . <end>   5.263563788286872
<start> <start> They had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs . <end>   4.64244223809729
<start> <start> Bennet was beyond the reach of reason ; and she continued to rail 
 bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of 
 five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about . <end>   3.813551667079024
<start> <start> " It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , " said Mr . Bennet , " and 
 nothing can clear Mr . Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . <end>   4.9988435884130675
<start> <start> But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little 
 softened by his manner of expressing himself . " 
 
 " No , that I am sure I shall not ; and I think it was very impertinent of 
 him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . <end>   7.010753955730115
<start> <start> I hate such false 
 friends . <end>   4.705349674764396
<start> <start> Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father 
 did before him ? " 
 
 " Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that 
 head , as you will hear . "

 DEAR SIR , 
 
 The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured 
 father , always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the 
 misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to heal the 
 breach ; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing 
 lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good 
 terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at 
 variance . - - " There , Mrs . <end>   4.833451281101679
<start> <start> Bennet . " - - My mind however is now made up on 
 the subject , for having received ordination at Easter , I have been 
 so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right 
 Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , 
 whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable 
 rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to 
 demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be 
 ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are 
 instituted by the Church of England . <end>   3.984769242017239
<start> <start> As a clergyman , moreover , I 
 feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in 
 all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds 
 I flatter myself that my present overtures of good - will are highly 
 commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the 
 entail of Longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , 
 and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . <end>   3.437290623649844
<start> <start> If you should have no objection to receive me 
 into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on 
 you and your family , Monday , November 18th , by four o 'clock , and 
 shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday 
 se' night following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as 
 Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a 
 Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the 
 duty of the day . <end>   4.091957778945208
<start> <start> I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to 
 your lady and daughters , your well - wisher and friend , 
 
 WILLIAM COLLINS . " 
 
 " At four o 'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace - making gentleman , " 
 said Mr . Bennet , as he folded up the letter . <end>   4.4350316979425
<start> <start> " He seems to be a most 
 conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and I doubt not will 
 prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so 
 indulgent as to let him come to us again . " 
 
 " There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he 
 is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to 
 discourage him . " 
 
 " Though it is difficult , " said Jane , " to guess in what way he can mean 
 to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his 
 credit . " 
 
 Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady 
 Catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying 
 his parishioners whenever it were required . <end>   4.460149843893457
<start> <start> " He must be an oddity , I think , " said she . <end>   7.301936177826877
<start> <start> There is a mixture of servility and self - importance in his 
 letter , which promises well . <end>   4.903342767316239
<start> <start> I am impatient to see him . " 
 
 " In point of composition , " said Mary , " his letter does not seem 
 defective . <end>   5.2433276317433215
<start> <start> It was next to impossible that their cousin should 
 come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had 
 received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour . <end>   4.971881844761531
<start> <start> Mr . Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great 
 politeness by the whole family . <end>   5.3780274868935765
<start> <start> Mr . Bennet indeed said little ; but the 
 ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr . Collins seemed neither in need 
 of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . <end>   5.277053638103746
<start> <start> He was a tall , 
 heavy looking young man of five and twenty . <end>   5.075011555793091
<start> <start> His air was grave and 
 stately , and his manners were very formal . <end>   5.917024105113035
<start> <start> He had not been long seated 
 before he complimented Mrs . <end>   3.876137877641751
<start> <start> Bennet on having so fine a family of 
 daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this 
 instance , fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did 
 not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . <end>   5.227118267539307
<start> <start> Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , 
 
 " You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may 
 prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough . <end>   4.1976208832464295
<start> <start> Things are settled so 
 oddly . " 
 
 " You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate . " 
 
 " Ah ! <end>   4.270597602247458
<start> <start> sir , I do indeed . <end>   13.651787689532808
<start> <start> It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you 
 must confess . <end>   5.665534321331623
<start> <start> Not that I mean to find fault with _you_ , for such things 
 I know are all chance in this world . <end>   6.0179609820172315
<start> <start> There is no knowing how estates 
 will go when once they come to be entailed . " 
 
 " I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , - - and 
 could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing 
 forward and precipitate . <end>   4.525022047767613
<start> <start> But I can assure the young ladies that I come 
 prepared to admire them . <end>   4.505528757454131
<start> <start> At present I will not say more , but perhaps 
 when we are better acquainted - - - - " 
 
 He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the girls smiled on each 
 other . <end>   5.775210940024315
<start> <start> They were not the only objects of Mr . Collins 's admiration . <end>   5.336590059773609
<start> <start> The 
 hall , the dining - room , and all its furniture were examined and praised ; 
 and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs . <end>   4.507927067842703
<start> <start> But here he was set right by Mrs . <end>   3.854104324270909
<start> <start> Bennet , who assured 
 him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good 
 cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen . <end>   6.659945856083656
<start> <start> He begged 
 pardon for having displeased her . <end>   3.2899396577927797
<start> <start> In a softened tone she declared 
 herself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a 
 quarter of an hour . <end>   4.044441200885604
<start> <start> CHAPTER XIV . 
 
 
 During dinner , Mr . Bennet scarcely spoke at all ; but when the servants 
 were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his 
 guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to 
 shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness . <end>   6.225832807216069
<start> <start> Lady 
 Catherine de Bourgh 's attention to his wishes , and consideration for his 
 comfort , appeared very remarkable . <end>   5.178581171089341
<start> <start> Mr . Bennet could not have chosen 
 better . <end>   5.606639624116656
<start> <start> She had been graciously pleased to 
 approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of 
 preaching before her . <end>   5.868200777632089
<start> <start> She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , 
 and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her pool of 
 quadrille in the evening . <end>   4.886841216031149
<start> <start> Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many 
 people he knew , but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her . <end>   3.8639179700386763
<start> <start> She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she 
 made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the 
 neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or 
 two , to visit his relations . <end>   5.889976547530796
<start> <start> Bennet , " and I 
 dare say she is a very agreeable woman . <end>   6.695603865064784
<start> <start> It is a pity that great ladies 
 in general are not more like her . <end>   4.118051989663451
<start> <start> Does she live near you , sir ? " 
 
 " The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane 
 from Rosings Park , her ladyship 's residence . " 
 
 " I think you said she was a widow , sir ? <end>   3.9480144950618787
<start> <start> has she any family ? " 
 
 " She has one only daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and of very 
 extensive property . " 
 
 " Ah ! " cried Mrs . <end>   4.278979295269348
<start> <start> Bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than 
 many girls . <end>   5.310044949887637
<start> <start> And what sort of young lady is she ? <end>   5.471112375173115
<start> <start> is she handsome ? " 
 
 " She is a most charming young lady indeed . <end>   3.9282900749091745
<start> <start> Lady Catherine herself says 
 that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the 
 handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks 
 the young woman of distinguished birth . <end>   4.955999030352947
<start> <start> She is unfortunately of a sickly 
 constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many 
 accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as I am 
 informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still 
 resides with them . <end>   3.4093282961602216
<start> <start> But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends 
 to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . " 
 
 " Has she been presented ? <end>   4.001255264510674
<start> <start> I do not remember her name among the ladies at 
 court . " 
 
 " Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; 
 and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived 
 the British court of its brightest ornament . <end>   4.048198235467645
<start> <start> Her ladyship seemed pleased 
 with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to 
 offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to 
 ladies . <end>   5.21576268464301
<start> <start> I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her 
 charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most 
 elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by 
 her . - - These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and 
 it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to 
 pay . " 
 
 " You judge very properly , " said Mr . Bennet , " and it is happy for you 
 that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . <end>   4.754694763107247
<start> <start> May I ask 
 whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the 
 moment , or are the result of previous study ? " 
 
 " They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I 
 sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant 
 compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to 
 give them as unstudied an air as possible . " 
 
 Mr . Bennet 's expectations were fully answered . <end>   3.595765382439911
<start> <start> His cousin was as absurd 
 as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , 
 maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , 
 and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth , requiring no partner in 
 his pleasure . <end>   5.230190040855821
<start> <start> By tea - time however the dose had been enough , and Mr . Bennet was glad to 
 take his guest into the drawing - room again , and when tea was over , glad 
 to invite him to read aloud to the ladies . <end>   5.215898136476821
<start> <start> Mr . Collins readily assented , 
 and a book was produced ; but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced 
 it to be from a circulating library , ) he started back , and begging 
 pardon , protested that he never read novels . - - Kitty stared at him , and 
 Lydia exclaimed . - - Other books were produced , and after some deliberation 
 he chose Fordyce 's Sermons . <end>   4.460838779001118
<start> <start> Lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and 
 before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she 
 interrupted him with , 
 
 " Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard , 
 and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him . <end>   4.323258481877867
<start> <start> I shall walk to Meryton to - morrow to hear more 
 about it , and to ask when Mr . Denny comes back from town . " 
 
 Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue ; but Mr . 
 Collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , 
 
 " I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books 
 of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit . <end>   3.9867370184161555
<start> <start> It amazes 
 me , I confess ; - - for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to 
 them as instruction . <end>   5.297795689135526
<start> <start> But I will no longer importune my young cousin . " 
 
 Then turning to Mr . Bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at 
 backgammon . <end>   3.9917005649856168
<start> <start> Mr . Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted 
 very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements . <end>   3.572987347792268
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> CHAPTER XV . 
 
 
 Mr . Collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had 
 been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of 
 his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and 
 miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he 
 had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful 
 acquaintance . <end>   3.986446646628097
<start> <start> The subjection in which his father had brought him up , had 
 given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good 
 deal counteracted by the self - conceit of a weak head , living in 
 retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected 
 prosperity . <end>   4.158511335661656
<start> <start> A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de 
 Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant ; and the respect which he 
 felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , 
 mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a 
 clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of 
 pride and obsequiousness , self - importance and humility . <end>   4.712687262635472
<start> <start> Having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to 
 marry ; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had 
 a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found 
 them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report . <end>   5.034822994012591
<start> <start> This was his plan of amends - - of atonement - - for inheriting their father 's 
 estate ; and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and 
 suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own 
 part . <end>   5.391510019351858
<start> <start> His plan did not vary on seeing them . - - Miss Bennet 's lovely face 
 confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what 
 was due to seniority ; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled 
 choice . <end>   4.847590685006785
<start> <start> The next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter 
 of an hour 's tête - à - tête with Mrs . <end>   4.266539891758676
<start> <start> Bennet before breakfast , a 
 conversation beginning with his parsonage - house , and leading naturally 
 to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at 
 Longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general 
 encouragement , a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on . - - " As to 
 her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say - - she could 
 not positively answer - - but she did not _know_ of any prepossession ; - - her 
 _eldest_ daughter , she must just mention - - she felt it incumbent on her 
 to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . " 
 
 Mr . Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth - - and it was soon 
 done - - done while Mrs . <end>   5.969043964515506
<start> <start> Bennet was stirring the fire . <end>   4.065017192950577
<start> <start> Elizabeth , equally 
 next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course . <end>   4.2725726066054746
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have 
 two daughters married ; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of 
 the day before , was now high in her good graces . <end>   6.157727623852813
<start> <start> Lydia 's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten ; every sister 
 except Mary agreed to go with her ; and Mr . Collins was to attend them , 
 at the request of Mr . Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , 
 and have his library to himself ; for thither Mr . Collins had followed 
 him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with 
 one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to Mr . 
 Bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at Hunsford . <end>   5.410458692794459
<start> <start> Such 
 doings discomposed Mr . Bennet exceedingly . <end>   4.679955588353173
<start> <start> In his library he had been 
 always sure of leisure and tranquillity ; and though prepared , as he told 
 Elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the 
 house , he was used to be free from them there ; his civility , therefore , 
 was most prompt in inviting Mr . Collins to join his daughters in their 
 walk ; and Mr . Collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker 
 than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and 
 go . <end>   5.355250080742201
<start> <start> In pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his 
 cousins , their time passed till they entered Meryton . <end>   4.478452312622056
<start> <start> The attention of 
 the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_ . <end>   6.146785782185464
<start> <start> Their eyes 
 were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , 
 and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin 
 in a shop window , could recal them . <end>   4.660522167237257
<start> <start> But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom 
 they had never seen before , of most gentleman - like appearance , walking 
 with an officer on the other side of the way . <end>   4.946761850107686
<start> <start> The officer was the very 
 Mr . Denny , concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire , 
 and he bowed as they passed . <end>   4.770361361252151
<start> <start> Mr . Denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to 
 introduce his friend , Mr . Wickham , who had returned with him the day 
 before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in 
 their corps . <end>   5.754133022264076
<start> <start> This was exactly as it should be ; for the young man wanted 
 only regimentals to make him completely charming . <end>   5.987212608012516
<start> <start> His appearance was 
 greatly in his favour ; he had all the best part of beauty , a fine 
 countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address . <end>   6.814920553101009
<start> <start> The introduction 
 was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation - - a 
 readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the 
 whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , 
 when the sound of horses drew their notice , and Darcy and Bingley were 
 seen riding down the street . <end>   3.7245461892884997
<start> <start> Bingley was the principal spokesman , and Miss Bennet the 
 principal object . <end>   8.967593195955484
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy corroborated it with a bow , and 
 was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they 
 were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and Elizabeth 
 happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , 
 was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting . <end>   6.267773707374135
<start> <start> What could be the meaning of it ? - - It was impossible to imagine ; it was 
 impossible not to long to know . <end>   6.210643581564126
<start> <start> In another minute Mr . Bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what 
 passed , took leave and rode on with his friend . <end>   4.242052179753282
<start> <start> Mr . Denny and Mr . Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of 
 Mr . Philips 's house , and then made their bows , in spite of Miss Lydia 's 
 pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of Mrs . <end>   5.401228231382357
<start> <start> Philips 'throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the 
 invitation . <end>   6.285946385063075
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from 
 their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly 
 expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own 
 carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if 
 she had not happened to see Mr . Jones 's shop boy in the street , who had 
 told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield 
 because the Miss Bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed 
 towards Mr . Collins by Jane 's introduction of him . <end>   4.989843658149026
<start> <start> She received him with 
 her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , 
 apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with 
 her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be 
 justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to 
 her notice . <end>   5.534595768219282
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good 
 breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to 
 by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she 
 could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr . Denny had 
 brought him from London , and that he was to have a lieutenant 's 
 commission in the - - - - shire . <end>   5.54204347414952
<start> <start> She had been watching him the last hour , 
 she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had Mr . Wickham 
 appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , 
 but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the 
 officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , 
 disagreeable fellows . " Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the 
 next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr . 
 Wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from Longbourn 
 would come in the evening . <end>   5.916883811293313
<start> <start> This was agreed to , and Mrs . <end>   8.040345880132561
<start> <start> Philips 
 protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery 
 tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards . <end>   3.7106985175026344
<start> <start> The prospect of such 
 delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits . <end>   4.114668781567503

 Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured 
 with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless . <end>   3.6577298731827743
<start> <start> Mr . Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs . <end>   4.59711033954221

<start> <start> Philips 's manners and politeness . <end>   4.650827962742178
<start> <start> He protested that except Lady 
 Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman ; for 
 she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even 
 pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although 
 utterly unknown to her before . <end>   4.75908561850179
<start> <start> Something he supposed might be attributed 
 to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much 
 attention in the whole course of his life . <end>   7.381075838431561
<start> <start> CHAPTER XVI . 
 
 
 As no objection was made to the young people 's engagement with their 
 aunt , and all Mr . Collins 's scruples of leaving Mr . and Mrs . <end>   4.542284195423942
<start> <start> Bennet for 
 a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach 
 conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton ; and the 
 girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing - room , 
 that Mr . Wickham had accepted their uncle 's invitation , and was then in 
 the house . <end>   4.455047237106955
<start> <start> When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr . 
 Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much 
 struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he 
 might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour 
 at Rosings ; a comparison that did not at first convey much 
 gratification ; but when Mrs . <end>   4.591692557843517
<start> <start> Philips understood from him what Rosings 
 was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the 
 description of only one of Lady Catherine 's drawing - rooms , and found 
 that the chimney - piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all 
 the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison 
 with the housekeeper 's room . <end>   5.257774851742856
<start> <start> In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion , 
 with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the 
 improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the 
 gentlemen joined them ; and he found in Mrs . <end>   5.075996172714725
<start> <start> Philips a very attentive 
 listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she 
 heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as 
 soon as she could . <end>   5.047336379243179
<start> <start> To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , 
 and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine 
 their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle - piece , the 
 interval of waiting appeared very long . <end>   5.822051832128685
<start> <start> It was over at last however . <end>   7.133501354797124
<start> <start> The 
 gentlemen did approach ; and when Mr . Wickham walked into the room , 
 Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking 
 of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration . <end>   5.761645731835627
<start> <start> The 
 officers of the - - - - shire were in general a very creditable , 
 gentleman - like set , and the best of them were of the present party ; but 
 Mr . Wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and 
 walk , as _they_ were superior to the broad - faced stuffy uncle Philips , 
 breathing port wine , who followed them into the room . <end>   5.470589917629572
<start> <start> Mr . Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was 
 turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated 
 himself ; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into 
 conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the 
 probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , 
 dullest , most thread - bare topic might be rendered interesting by the 
 skill of the speaker . <end>   4.521294394833781
<start> <start> Philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most 
 abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin . <end>   5.3635224607735585
<start> <start> " I know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but I shall be glad 
 to improve myself , for in my situation of life - - - - " Mrs . <end>   7.2061025481171335
<start> <start> Philips was 
 very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason . <end>   7.174591412023115
<start> <start> Mr . Wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he 
 received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia . <end>   5.535603125222271
<start> <start> Allowing for the common demands of the game , Mr . Wickham was 
 therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to 
 hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to 
 be told , the history of his acquaintance with Mr . Darcy . <end>   7.1463530075308555
<start> <start> He inquired how far 
 Netherfield was from Meryton ; and , after receiving her answer , asked in 
 an hesitating manner how long Mr . Darcy had been staying there . <end>   4.483781836024264
<start> <start> " About a month , " said Elizabeth ; and then , unwilling to let the subject 
 drop , added , " He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I 
 understand . " 
 
 " Yes , " replied Wickham ; - - " his estate there is a noble one . <end>   4.701872049082664
<start> <start> A clear ten 
 thousand per annum . <end>   3.652628284451669
<start> <start> You could not have met with a person more capable of 
 giving you certain information on that head than myself - - for I have been 
 connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . " 
 
 Elizabeth could not but look surprised . <end>   4.552115049032924
<start> <start> " You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after 
 seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting 
 yesterday . - - Are you much acquainted with Mr . Darcy ? " 
 
 " As much as I ever wish to be , " cried Elizabeth warmly , - - " I have spent 
 four days in the same house with him , and I think him very 
 disagreeable . " 
 
 " I have no right to give _my_ opinion , " said Wickham , " as to his being 
 agreeable or otherwise . <end>   5.220122440047851
<start> <start> I am not qualified to form one . <end>   3.7156739086625
<start> <start> I have known him 
 too long and too well to be a fair judge . <end>   4.716317816517489
<start> <start> It is impossible for _me_ to 
 be impartial . <end>   5.706616077685437
<start> <start> He is not at all liked in 
 Hertfordshire . <end>   9.407724997399832
<start> <start> Every body is disgusted with his pride . <end>   5.057345149635029
<start> <start> You will not find 
 him more favourably spoken of by any one . " 
 
 " I cannot pretend to be sorry , " said Wickham , after a short 
 interruption , " that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond 
 their deserts ; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen . <end>   4.842827697265547
<start> <start> The 
 world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his 
 high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen . " 
 
 " I should take him , even on _my_ slight acquaintance , to be an 
 ill - tempered man . " Wickham only shook his head . <end>   5.10647012360153
<start> <start> " I wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is 
 likely to be in this country much longer . " 
 
 " I do not at all know ; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I 
 was at Netherfield . <end>   6.605564111114126
<start> <start> I hope your plans in favour of the - - - - shire will 
 not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   5.917860118345281
<start> <start> no - - it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr . Darcy . <end>   6.542067316885103
<start> <start> If _he_ 
 wishes to avoid seeing _me_ , he must go . <end>   5.0633048818270066
<start> <start> His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr . Darcy , was one of the best men 
 that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ; and I can never be 
 in company with this Mr . Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a 
 thousand tender recollections . <end>   6.669211515709294
<start> <start> Mr . Wickham began to speak on more general topics , Meryton , the 
 neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he 
 had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but 
 very intelligible gallantry . <end>   6.166734045484999
<start> <start> I knew it to be a 
 most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me 
 farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great 
 attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them . <end>   4.173162840740665
<start> <start> I _must_ have employment and society . <end>   3.3334123238285422
<start> <start> A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have 
 now made it eligible . <end>   6.825873828220988
<start> <start> The church _ought_ to have been my profession - - I 
 was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in 
 possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we 
 were speaking of just now . " 
 
 " Indeed ! " 
 
 " Yes - - the late Mr . Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best 
 living in his gift . <end>   5.260069373339072
<start> <start> He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me . <end>   4.902901458917447
<start> <start> I cannot do justice to his kindness . <end>   5.46358672029559
<start> <start> He meant to provide for me amply , 
 and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given 
 elsewhere . " 
 
 " Good heavens ! " cried Elizabeth ; " but how could _that_ be ? - - How could 
 his will be disregarded ? - - Why did not you seek legal redress ? " 
 
 " There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to 
 give me no hope from law . <end>   4.961288770769937
<start> <start> A man of honour could not have doubted the 
 intention , but Mr . Darcy chose to doubt it - - or to treat it as a merely 
 conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim 
 to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing . <end>   4.810456488804097
<start> <start> Certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I 
 was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no 
 less certain is it , that I cannot accuse myself of having really done 
 any thing to deserve to lose it . <end>   5.2307078787319305
<start> <start> I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I 
 may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him , and _to_ him , too 
 freely . <end>   5.545547158742091
<start> <start> I can recal nothing worse . <end>   5.167175914109165
<start> <start> " But what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ? - - what 
 can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? " 
 
 " A thorough , determined dislike of me - - a dislike which I cannot but 
 attribute in some measure to jealousy . <end>   4.199480920700504
<start> <start> Had the late Mr . Darcy liked me 
 less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father 's uncommon 
 attachment to me , irritated him I believe very early in life . <end>   4.329819707971403
<start> <start> He had not 
 a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood - - the sort of 
 preference which was often given me . " 
 
 " I had not thought Mr . Darcy so bad as this - - though I have never liked 
 him , I had not thought so very ill of him - - I had supposed him to be 
 despising his fellow - creatures in general , but did not suspect him of 
 descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as 
 this ! " 
 
 After a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " I _do_ remember 
 his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his 
 resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper . <end>   4.848413476853551
<start> <start> His disposition must 
 be dreadful . " 
 
 " I will not trust myself on the subject , " replied Wickham , " _I_ can 
 hardly be just to him . " 
 
 Elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " To 
 treat in such a manner , the god - son , the friend , the favourite of his 
 father ! " - - She could have added , " A young man too , like _you_ , whose very 
 countenance may vouch for your being amiable " - - but she contented 
 herself with " And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from 
 childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest 
 manner ! " 
 
 " We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest 
 part of our youth was passed together ; inmates of the same house , 
 sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care . <end>   5.5254443308058185
<start> <start> _My_ 
 father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr . Philips , 
 appears to do so much credit to - - but he gave up every thing to be of use 
 to the late Mr . Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the 
 Pemberley property . <end>   7.0362677863328775
<start> <start> He was most highly esteemed by Mr . Darcy , a most 
 intimate , confidential friend . <end>   3.7248867416689366
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy often acknowledged himself to 
 be under the greatest obligations to my father 's active superintendance , 
 and when immediately before my father 's death , Mr . Darcy gave him a 
 voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to 
 be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ , as of affection to myself . " 
 
 " How strange ! " cried Elizabeth . <end>   4.340724240927562
<start> <start> " How abominable ! - - I wonder that the very 
 pride of this Mr . Darcy has not made him just to you ! - - If from no better 
 motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest , - - for 
 dishonesty I must call it . " 
 
 " It _is_ wonderful , " - - replied Wickham , - - " for almost all his actions may 
 be traced to pride ; - - and pride has often been his best friend . <end>   4.935313914777217
<start> <start> It has 
 connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . <end>   3.415949457961026
<start> <start> But we are none 
 of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger 
 impulses even than pride . " 
 
 " Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? " 
 
 " Yes . <end>   4.136123490254694
<start> <start> It has often led him to be liberal and generous , - - to give his 
 money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve 
 the poor . <end>   5.897169594070856
<start> <start> Family pride , and _filial_ pride , for he is very proud of what 
 his father was , have done this . <end>   8.768271106472335
<start> <start> Not to appear to disgrace his family , to 
 degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the 
 Pemberley House , is a powerful motive . <end>   5.2427022248776245
<start> <start> But she is too much like her brother , - - very , 
 very proud . - - As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and 
 extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her 
 amusement . <end>   6.496729124656781
<start> <start> But she is nothing to me now . <end>   10.319186391916464
<start> <start> How can Mr . Bingley , 
 who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , 
 be in friendship with such a man ? <end>   7.294383031562174
<start> <start> How can they suit each other ? - - Do you 
 know Mr . Bingley ? " 
 
 " Not at all . " 
 
 " He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man . <end>   4.4006465865873965
<start> <start> He does not 
 want abilities . <end>   8.51104367906399
<start> <start> He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth 
 his while . <end>   4.743018385608772
<start> <start> His pride 
 never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal - minded , just , 
 sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , - - allowing 
 something for fortune and figure . " 
 
 The whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round 
 the other table , and Mr . Collins took his station between his cousin 
 Elizabeth and Mrs . <end>   4.2843786105779715
<start> <start> Philips . - - The usual inquiries as to his success were 
 made by the latter . <end>   7.015130975546086
<start> <start> It had not been very great ; he had lost every point ; 
 but when Mrs . <end>   4.948438527666298
<start> <start> Philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured 
 her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , 
 that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not 
 make herself uneasy . <end>   5.812566989004725
<start> <start> " I know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a 
 card table , they must take their chance of these things , - - and happily I 
 am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object . <end>   4.522280040046739
<start> <start> There 
 are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady 
 Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding 
 little matters . " 
 
 Mr . Wickham 's attention was caught ; and after observing Mr . Collins for 
 a few moments , he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation 
 were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh . <end>   4.4688204942335625
<start> <start> " Lady Catherine de Bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately given him a 
 living . <end>   5.343284574752505
<start> <start> I hardly know how Mr . Collins was first introduced to her 
 notice , but he certainly has not known her long . " 
 
 " You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy 
 were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr . Darcy . " 
 
 " No , indeed , I did not . - - I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine 's 
 connections . <end>   5.193170066079101
<start> <start> Vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her 
 affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already 
 self - destined to another . <end>   4.859949241914751
<start> <start> " Mr . Collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her 
 daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , 
 I suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his 
 patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . " 
 
 " I believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied Wickham ; " I have 
 not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked 
 her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent . <end>   5.4766353702471555
<start> <start> She has the 
 reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe 
 she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from 
 her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who 
 chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of 
 the first class . " 
 
 Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and 
 they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put 
 an end to cards ; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr . 
 Wickham 's attentions . <end>   4.809742741758424
<start> <start> There could be no conversation in the noise of 
 Mrs . <end>   7.496335508841652
<start> <start> Whatever he said , was said well ; and whatever he did , done 
 gracefully . <end>   5.397969512995138
<start> <start> Lydia 
 talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the 
 fish she had won , and Mr . Collins , in describing the civility of Mr . and 
 Mrs . <end>   5.28714884395021
<start> <start> Philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses 
 at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing 
 that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage 
 before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House . <end>   4.772304783424898
<start> <start> CHAPTER XVII . 
 
 
 Elizabeth related to Jane the next day , what had passed between Mr . 
 Wickham and herself . <end>   5.583870638566129
<start> <start> Jane listened with astonishment and concern ; - - she 
 knew not how to believe that Mr . Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr . 
 Bingley 's regard ; and yet , it was not in her nature to question the 
 veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham . - - The 
 possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to 
 interest all her tender feelings ; and nothing therefore remained to be 
 done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and 
 throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be 
 otherwise explained . <end>   5.04232107748649
<start> <start> " They have both , " said she , " been deceived , I dare say , in some way or 
 other , of which we can form no idea . <end>   4.652683999393876
<start> <start> Interested people have perhaps 
 misrepresented each to the other . <end>   4.176061592446963
<start> <start> It is , in short , impossible for us to 
 conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , 
 without actual blame on either side . " 
 
 " Very true , indeed ; - - and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in 
 behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the 
 business ? - - Do clear _them_ too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of 
 somebody . " 
 
 " Laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my 
 opinion . <end>   4.832279079045848
<start> <start> My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light 
 it places Mr . Darcy , to be treating his father 's favourite in such a 
 manner , - - one , whom his father had promised to provide for . - - It is 
 impossible . <end>   5.516464438925321
<start> <start> No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his 
 character , could be capable of it . <end>   5.216519138254715
<start> <start> Can his most intimate friends be so 
 excessively deceived in him ? <end>   3.899882999060934
<start> <start> oh ! <end>   21.420661255697155
<start> <start> no . " 
 
 " I can much more easily believe Mr . Bingley 's being imposed on , than 
 that Mr . Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me 
 last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony . - - If it 
 be not so , let Mr . Darcy contradict it . <end>   4.794549332801904
<start> <start> Besides , there was truth in his 
 looks . " 
 
 " It is difficult indeed - - it is distressing . - - One does not know what to 
 think . " 
 
 " I beg your pardon ; - - one knows exactly what to think . " 
 
 But Jane could think with certainty on only one point , - - that Mr . 
 Bingley , if he _had been_ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the 
 affair became public . <end>   4.701310580757781
<start> <start> The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this 
 conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom 
 they had been speaking ; Mr . Bingley and his sisters came to give their 
 personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield , which was 
 fixed for the following Tuesday . <end>   5.187404964841711
<start> <start> The two ladies were delighted to see 
 their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and 
 repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their 
 separation . <end>   4.210362606686777
<start> <start> To the rest of the family they paid little attention ; 
 avoiding Mrs . <end>   3.887981830212443
<start> <start> Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Elizabeth , 
 and nothing at all to the others . <end>   6.740757173010935
<start> <start> Bennet 's civilities . <end>   5.8321515827060795
<start> <start> The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every 
 female of the family . <end>   5.6719594672812095
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet chose to consider it as given in 
 compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by 
 receiving the invitation from Mr . Bingley himself , instead of a 
 ceremonious card . <end>   5.838656077446671
<start> <start> Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the 
 society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother ; and 
 Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr . 
 Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr . Darcy 's 
 looks and behaviour . <end>   5.744405953955637
<start> <start> The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia , 
 depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though 
 they each , like Elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with Mr . 
 Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and 
 a ball was at any rate , a ball . <end>   5.191931180152779
<start> <start> " While I can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough . - - I 
 think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . <end>   4.866891051681172
<start> <start> Society has claims on us all ; and I profess myself one of those who 
 consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every 
 body . " 
 
 Elizabeth 's spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did 
 not often speak unnecessarily to Mr . Collins , she could not help asking 
 him whether he intended to accept Mr . Bingley 's invitation , and if he 
 did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening 's 
 amusement ; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no 
 scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke 
 either from the Archbishop , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to 
 dance . <end>   4.480144718501271
<start> <start> " I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , " said he , " that a ball of 
 this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can 
 have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself 
 that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins 
 in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting 
 yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , - - a 
 preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right 
 cause , and not to any disrespect for her . " 
 
 Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in . <end>   5.141323995132717
<start> <start> She had fully proposed being 
 engaged by Wickham for those very dances : - - and to have Mr . Collins 
 instead ! <end>   3.9838310260746894
<start> <start> her liveliness had been never worse timed . <end>   5.075654359319509
<start> <start> There was no help 
 for it however . <end>   9.100761302607516
<start> <start> Mr . Wickham 's happiness and her own was per force 
 delayed a little longer , and Mr . Collins 's proposal accepted with as 
 good a grace as she could . <end>   4.639608251749127
<start> <start> The idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing 
 civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a 
 compliment on her wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than 
 gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before 
 her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage 
 was exceedingly agreeable to _her_ . <end>   5.123309667595616
<start> <start> Mr . Collins might never make the offer , and 
 till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him . <end>   4.772262887853372
<start> <start> If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the 
 younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , 
 for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was 
 such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once . <end>   6.326465674814828
<start> <start> No 
 aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after ; - - the very shoe - roses 
 for Netherfield were got by proxy . <end>   3.738275955042927
<start> <start> Even Elizabeth might have found some 
 trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the 
 improvement of her acquaintance with Mr . Wickham ; and nothing less than 
 a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday and 
 Monday , endurable to Kitty and Lydia . <end>   4.962557750444154
<start> <start> The certainty of 
 meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that 
 might not unreasonably have alarmed her . <end>   4.259401158362524
<start> <start> She had dressed with more than 
 usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all 
 that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than 
 might be won in the course of the evening . <end>   6.090096117199052
<start> <start> But in an instant arose the 
 dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr . Darcy 's 
 pleasure in the Bingleys 'invitation to the officers ; and though this 
 was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was 
 pronounced by his friend Mr . Denny , to whom Lydia eagerly applied , and 
 who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business 
 the day before , and was not yet returned ; adding , with a significant 
 smile , 
 
 " I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if 
 he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . " 
 
 This part of his intelligence , though unheard by Lydia , was caught by 
 Elizabeth , and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for 
 Wickham 's absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling 
 of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate 
 disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to 
 the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to 
 make . - - Attention , forbearance , patience with Darcy , was injury to 
 Wickham . <end>   5.153305796291115
<start> <start> She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and 
 turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly 
 surmount even in speaking to Mr . Bingley , whose blind partiality 
 provoked her . <end>   4.755562822159992
<start> <start> But Elizabeth was not formed for ill - humour ; and though every prospect 
 of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her 
 spirits ; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had 
 not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to 
 the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular 
 notice . <end>   5.902403431661375
<start> <start> The two first dances , however , brought a return of distress ; 
 they were dances of mortification . <end>   3.4094397138222314
<start> <start> The moment of her release from 
 him was ecstacy . <end>   7.4131276865171465
<start> <start> She danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of 
 Wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked . <end>   5.90357498450156
<start> <start> When those dances 
 were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas , and was in conversation with 
 her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr . Darcy , who took 
 her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without 
 knowing what she did , she accepted him . <end>   5.889512056087499
<start> <start> He walked away again 
 immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of 
 mind ; Charlotte tried to console her . <end>   4.7238609527560635
<start> <start> " I dare say you will find him very agreeable . " 
 
 " Heaven forbid ! - - _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all ! - - To 
 find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! - - Do not wish me 
 such an evil . " 
 
 When the dancing recommenced , however , and Darcy approached to claim her 
 hand , Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a 
 simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant 
 in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence . <end>   4.218562341662971
<start> <start> Elizabeth made no 
 answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which 
 she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr . Darcy , and 
 reading in her neighbours 'looks their equal amazement in beholding it . <end>   4.424126774789916
<start> <start> They stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to 
 imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at 
 first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would 
 be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made 
 some slight observation on the dance . <end>   5.426392079412442
<start> <start> He replied , and was again silent . <end>   11.086638867336703
<start> <start> After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with 
 
 " It is _your_ turn to say something now , Mr . Darcy . - - _I_ talked about 
 the dance , and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of 
 the room , or the number of couples . " 
 
 He smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be 
 said . <end>   5.583339098127921
<start> <start> " Very well . - - That reply will do for the present . - - Perhaps by and bye I 
 may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public 
 ones . - - But _now_ we may be silent . " 
 
 " Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? " 
 
 " Sometimes . <end>   3.6977991115516327
<start> <start> One must speak a little , you know . <end>   8.08424674380972
<start> <start> It would look odd to be 
 entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of 
 _some_ , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the 
 trouble of saying as little as possible . " 
 
 " Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you 
 imagine that you are gratifying mine ? " 
 
 " Both , " replied Elizabeth archly ; " for I have always seen a great 
 similarity in the turn of our minds . - - We are each of an unsocial , 
 taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say 
 something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to 
 posterity with all the eclat of a proverb . " 
 
 " This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , " 
 said he . <end>   4.901340147749348
<start> <start> She answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist 
 the temptation , added , " When you met us there the other day , we had just 
 been forming a new acquaintance . " 
 
 The effect was immediate . <end>   4.756666290594503
<start> <start> At length Darcy spoke , and in a 
 constrained manner said , 
 
 " Mr . Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his 
 _making_ friends - - whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them , 
 is less certain . " 
 
 " He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship , " replied Elizabeth 
 with emphasis , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all 
 his life . " 
 
 Darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject . <end>   5.212539962031887
<start> <start> At 
 that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass 
 through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving Mr . 
 Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his 
 dancing and his partner . <end>   4.4393291573779265
<start> <start> " I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Sir . <end>   5.971371425107725
<start> <start> Such very 
 superior dancing is not often seen . <end>   6.4910637571126015
<start> <start> It is evident that you belong to the 
 first circles . <end>   6.1019999872241435
<start> <start> What congratulations will 
 then flow in ! <end>   4.744816092801914
<start> <start> Sir William could not have 
 interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for 
 themselves . - - We have tried two or three subjects already without 
 success , and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine . " 
 
 " What think you of books ? " said he , smiling . <end>   4.703848385739291
<start> <start> no . - - I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same 
 feelings . " 
 
 " I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be 
 no want of subject . - - We may compare our different opinions . " 
 
 " No - - I cannot talk of books in a ball - room ; my head is always full of 
 something else . " 
 
 " The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes - - does it ? " said he , 
 with a look of doubt . <end>   5.00570191226385
<start> <start> " Yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her 
 thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared 
 by her suddenly exclaiming , " I remember hearing you once say , Mr . Darcy , 
 that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was 
 unappeasable . <end>   5.525560243151296
<start> <start> You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its _being 
 created_ . " 
 
 " I am , " said he , with a firm voice . <end>   3.966443257947502
<start> <start> " And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? " 
 
 " I hope not . " 
 
 " It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , 
 to be secure of judging properly at first . " 
 
 " May I ask to what these questions tend ? " 
 
 " Merely to the illustration of _your_ character , " said she , endeavouring 
 to shake off her gravity . <end>   3.6438253055558287
<start> <start> " I am trying to make it out . " 
 
 " And what is your success ? " 
 
 She shook her head . <end>   3.859548655803747
<start> <start> " I do not get on at all . <end>   3.9788219023903952
<start> <start> I hear such different 
 accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . " 
 
 " I can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary 
 greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were 
 not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to 
 fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . " 
 
 " But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another 
 opportunity . " 
 
 " I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied . <end>   4.3334503891192195
<start> <start> She said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in 
 silence ; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for 
 in Darcy 's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , 
 which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against 
 another . <end>   4.938878631927226
<start> <start> They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with 
 an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , 
 
 " So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George 
 Wickham ! - - Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a 
 thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , 
 among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the 
 late Mr . Darcy 's steward . <end>   5.643956876987516
<start> <start> I do not know the 
 particulars , but I know very well that Mr . Darcy is not in the least to 
 blame , that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that 
 though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his 
 invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had 
 taken himself out of the way . <end>   5.856632028930718
<start> <start> I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite 's guilt ; 
 but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . " 
 
 " His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , " said 
 Elizabeth angrily ; " for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse 
 than of being the son of Mr . Darcy 's steward , and of _that_ , I can 
 assure you , he informed me himself . " 
 
 " I beg your pardon , " replied Miss Bingley , turning away with a sneer . <end>   4.567674103452627
<start> <start> " Excuse my interference . - - It was kindly meant . " 
 
 " Insolent girl ! " said Elizabeth to herself . - - " You are much mistaken if 
 you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . <end>   4.739599431058737
<start> <start> I see 
 nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr . 
 Darcy . " She then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make 
 inquiries on the same subject of Bingley . <end>   5.455412749941954
<start> <start> " I want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her 
 sister 's , " what you have learnt about Mr . Wickham . <end>   5.959763906172139
<start> <start> But perhaps you have 
 been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case 
 you may be sure of my pardon . " 
 
 " No , " replied Jane , " I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing 
 satisfactory to tell you . <end>   5.15683577431782
<start> <start> Mr . Bingley does not know the whole of his 
 history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have 
 principally offended Mr . Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , 
 the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that 
 Mr . Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr . Darcy than he has 
 received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his 
 sister 's , Mr . Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . <end>   6.048917413491804
<start> <start> I am 
 afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr . Darcy 's 
 regard . " 
 
 " Mr . Bingley does not know Mr . Wickham himself ? " 
 
 " No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . " 
 
 " This account then is what he has received from Mr . Darcy . <end>   4.549289273915891
<start> <start> I am 
 perfectly satisfied . <end>   5.535847287572527
<start> <start> But what does he say of the living ? " 
 
 " He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard 
 them from Mr . Darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to 
 him _conditionally_ only . " 
 
 " I have not a doubt of Mr . Bingley 's sincerity , " said Elizabeth warmly ; 
 " but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . <end>   4.760749332621464
<start> <start> Mr . 
 Bingley 's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but 
 since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt 
 the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of 
 both gentlemen as I did before . " 
 
 She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on 
 which there could be no difference of sentiment . <end>   5.297875009938976
<start> <start> Elizabeth listened with 
 delight to the happy , though modest hopes which Jane entertained of 
 Bingley 's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence 
 in it . <end>   5.785799364762747
<start> <start> On their being joined by Mr . Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew 
 to Miss Lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last 
 partner she had scarcely replied , before Mr . Collins came up to them and 
 told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to 
 make a most important discovery . <end>   6.070560218209333
<start> <start> " I have found out , " said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now 
 in the room a near relation of my patroness . <end>   5.830133408795852
<start> <start> I happened to overhear the 
 gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of 
 this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother 
 Lady Catherine . <end>   5.722127199411304
<start> <start> How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! <end>   4.2676902607016896
<start> <start> Who would 
 have thought of my meeting with - - perhaps - - a nephew of Lady Catherine de 
 Bourgh in this assembly ! - - I am most thankful that the discovery is made 
 in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , 
 and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . <end>   4.76442374246105
<start> <start> I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . <end>   2.9095904702098867
<start> <start> I believe him to be Lady Catherine 's _nephew_ . <end>   8.634329018651506
<start> <start> It will be in my power to 
 assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se 'night . " 
 
 Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme ; assuring him 
 that Mr . Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as 
 an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it 
 was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either 
 side , and that if it were , it must belong to Mr . Darcy , the superior in 
 consequence , to begin the acquaintance . - - Mr . Collins listened to her 
 with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she 
 ceased speaking , replied thus , 
 
 " My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your 
 excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your 
 understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference 
 between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those 
 which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that I consider 
 the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank 
 in the kingdom - - provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the 
 same time maintained . <end>   4.741312711383639
<start> <start> You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates 
 of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look 
 on as a point of duty . <end>   4.735064173580986
<start> <start> Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your 
 advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though 
 in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and 
 habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like 
 yourself . " And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr . Darcy , whose 
 reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at 
 being so addressed was very evident . <end>   4.127855674712696
<start> <start> Her cousin prefaced his speech with 
 a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if 
 hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words " apology , " 
 " Hunsford , " and " Lady Catherine de Bourgh . " - - It vexed her to see him 
 expose himself to such a man . <end>   6.95010441036245
<start> <start> Mr . Collins , however , was not 
 discouraged from speaking again , and Mr . Darcy 's contempt seemed 
 abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the 
 end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way . <end>   4.774451435487649
<start> <start> Mr . 
 Collins then returned to Elizabeth . <end>   5.24045369594201
<start> <start> " I have no reason , I assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my 
 reception . <end>   5.149853692705914
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . <end>   5.547536176763966
<start> <start> He answered 
 me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , 
 that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine 's discernment as to be 
 certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . <end>   5.12158607890186
<start> <start> Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . " 
 
 As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned 
 her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr . Bingley , and the 
 train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , 
 made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane . <end>   5.012705702609032
<start> <start> She saw her in idea settled in 
 that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection 
 could bestow ; and she felt capable under such circumstances , of 
 endeavouring even to like Bingley 's two sisters . <end>   5.129294567123251
<start> <start> Her mother 's thoughts 
 she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to 
 venture near her , lest she might hear too much . <end>   5.18385823489127
<start> <start> When they sat down to 
 supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which 
 placed them within one of each other ; and deeply was she vexed to find 
 that her mother was talking to that one person ( Lady Lucas ) freely , 
 openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be 
 soon married to Mr . Bingley . - - It was an animating subject , and Mrs . <end>   5.603372321140936
<start> <start> Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of 
 the match . <end>   4.932288049059671
<start> <start> His being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living 
 but three miles from them , were the first points of self - gratulation ; 
 and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of 
 Jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as 
 she could do . <end>   6.81518715750366
<start> <start> It was 
 necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on 
 such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than Mrs . <end>   4.428438256614347
<start> <start> She 
 concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally 
 fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no 
 chance of it . <end>   3.6211055427300427
<start> <start> In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother 's 
 words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible 
 whisper ; for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the 
 chief of it was overheard by Mr . Darcy , who sat opposite to them . <end>   5.033541774254361
<start> <start> Her 
 mother only scolded her for being nonsensical . <end>   4.142232489711013
<start> <start> " What is Mr . Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ? <end>   8.2038323850787
<start> <start> I am 
 sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say 
 nothing _he_ may not like to hear . " 
 
 " For heaven 's sake , madam , speak lower . - - What advantage can it be to you 
 to offend Mr . Darcy ? - - You will never recommend yourself to his friend by 
 so doing . " 
 
 Nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . <end>   5.279076599958643
<start> <start> Her mother 
 would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . <end>   7.007510332744895
<start> <start> At length however Mrs . <end>   4.185641925057015
<start> <start> Elizabeth now began to revive . <end>   6.687166608425016
<start> <start> But not long was the interval of 
 tranquillity ; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she 
 had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very little entreaty , 
 preparing to oblige the company . <end>   5.4803051300442265
<start> <start> By many significant looks and silent 
 entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of 
 complaisance , - - but in vain ; Mary would not understand them ; such an 
 opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song . <end>   3.883213394516635
<start> <start> Elizabeth 's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations ; and she 
 watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience 
 which was very ill rewarded at their close ; for Mary , on receiving 
 amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be 
 prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute 
 began another . <end>   4.786769451780476
<start> <start> Mary 's powers were by no means fitted for such a display ; 
 her voice was weak , and her manner affected . - - Elizabeth was in agonies . <end>   5.470464797062607
<start> <start> She looked at Jane , to see how she bore it ; but Jane was very composedly 
 talking to Bingley . <end>   6.434669475209259
<start> <start> She looked at his two sisters , and saw them making 
 signs of derision at each other , and at Darcy , who continued however 
 impenetrably grave . <end>   4.009765460128282
<start> <start> She looked at her father to entreat his 
 interference , lest Mary should be singing all night . <end>   3.670991074846191
<start> <start> He took the hint , 
 and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud , 
 
 " That will do extremely well , child . <end>   4.278750275433169
<start> <start> You have delighted us long enough . <end>   3.991093680954306
<start> <start> Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . " 
 
 Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted ; and 
 Elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father 's speech , was afraid 
 her anxiety had done no good . - - Others of the party were now applied to . <end>   6.947404963436832
<start> <start> The 
 rector of a parish has much to do . - - In the first place , he must make 
 such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not 
 offensive to his patron . <end>   5.664750247340324
<start> <start> He must write his own sermons ; and the time 
 that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care 
 and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making 
 as comfortable as possible . <end>   5.807628539359449
<start> <start> And I do not think it of light importance 
 that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every 
 body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . <end>   3.419332646652453
<start> <start> To Elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to 
 expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would 
 have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or 
 finer success ; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister 
 that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his 
 feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he 
 must have witnessed . <end>   6.217760460466192
<start> <start> That his two sisters and Mr . Darcy , however , should 
 have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and 
 she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or 
 the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . <end>   5.696934390458526
<start> <start> She was teazed by 
 Mr . Collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he 
 could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her 
 power to dance with others . <end>   6.060010350234082
<start> <start> In vain did she entreat him to stand up with 
 somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room . <end>   6.91128222526832
<start> <start> He assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it ; 
 that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to 
 her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her 
 the whole evening . <end>   6.148849389600941
<start> <start> She was at least free from the offence of Mr . Darcy 's farther notice ; 
 though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite 
 disengaged , he never came near enough to speak . <end>   5.049364372619641
<start> <start> She felt it to be the 
 probable consequence of her allusions to Mr . Wickham , and rejoiced in 
 it . <end>   8.114700134974699
<start> <start> The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart ; and by a 
 manoeuvre of Mrs . <end>   5.83332177922779
<start> <start> Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of 
 an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how 
 heartily they were wished away by some of the family . <end>   4.75869196443258
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Hurst and her 
 sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and 
 were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . <end>   4.079177809960528
<start> <start> They repulsed 
 every attempt of Mrs . <end>   4.534511740721206
<start> <start> Darcy said 
 nothing at all . <end>   6.988007699781499
<start> <start> Mr . Bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . <end>   5.738852065183405
<start> <start> Mr . Bingley and Jane were standing together , a little detached from the 
 rest , and talked only to each other . <end>   5.707687625737525
<start> <start> Elizabeth preserved as steady a 
 silence as either Mrs . <end>   3.893846979214693
<start> <start> Hurst or Miss Bingley ; and even Lydia was too 
 much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " Lord , 
 how tired I am ! " accompanied by a violent yawn . <end>   5.043974986298663
<start> <start> When at length they arose to take leave , Mrs . <end>   3.6944077869142595
<start> <start> Bingley was all grateful 
 pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of 
 waiting on her , after his return from London , whither he was obliged to 
 go the next day for a short time . <end>   5.943183356373045
<start> <start> Bennet was perfectly satisfied ; and quitted the house under the 
 delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of 
 settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly 
 see her daughter settled at Netherfield , in the course of three or four 
 months . <end>   4.71122270328512
<start> <start> Of having another daughter married to Mr . Collins , she thought 
 with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure . <end>   4.746106804655012
<start> <start> CHAPTER XIX . 
 
 
 The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn . <end>   4.504971262506652
<start> <start> Having resolved to do it without loss of time , as 
 his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday , and having 
 no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the 
 moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the 
 observances which he supposed a regular part of the business . <end>   5.845259480432266
<start> <start> On finding 
 Mrs . <end>   4.8108988466654
<start> <start> Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon 
 after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , 
 
 " May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , 
 when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the 
 course of this morning ? " 
 
 Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , Mrs . <end>   5.807536993208887
<start> <start> I am 
 going away myself . " 
 
 " No , no , nonsense , Lizzy . - - I desire you will stay where you are . " - - And 
 upon Elizabeth 's seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about 
 to escape , she added , " Lizzy , I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing 
 Mr . Collins . " 
 
 Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction - - and a moment 's 
 consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it 
 over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried 
 to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided 
 between distress and diversion . <end>   4.517915877348177
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> You can hardly doubt the purport 
 of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to 
 dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . <end>   4.320559718950102
<start> <start> But before I am run away with by my feelings on this 
 subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for 
 marrying - - and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of 
 selecting a wife , as I certainly did . " 
 
 The idea of Mr . Collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away 
 with by his feelings , made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not 
 use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and 
 he continued : 
 
 " My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for 
 every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example 
 of matrimony in his parish . <end>   4.348339363079173
<start> <start> Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! ) on this 
 subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left 
 Hunsford - - between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs . <end>   3.705747461976962
<start> <start> A clergyman like you must marry . - - Chuse properly , chuse a 
 gentlewoman for _my_ sake ; and for your _own_ , let her be an active , 
 useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small 
 income go a good way . <end>   4.3452162462205415
<start> <start> Find such a woman as soon as 
 you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . 'Allow me , by the 
 way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and 
 kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the 
 advantages in my power to offer . <end>   6.322153271678713
<start> <start> You will find her manners beyond any 
 thing I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity I think must be 
 acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect 
 which her rank will inevitably excite . <end>   4.430687203466577
<start> <start> Thus much for my general 
 intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views 
 were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I 
 assure you there are many amiable young women . <end>   4.006177304419922
<start> <start> But the fact is , that 
 being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured 
 father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) I could not satisfy 
 myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that 
 the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy 
 event takes place - - which , however , as I have already said , may not be 
 for several years . <end>   5.3706558080316364
<start> <start> This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I 
 flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . <end>   5.44025614284506
<start> <start> And now nothing 
 remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the 
 violence of my affection . <end>   5.451258467841509
<start> <start> To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and 
 shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well 
 aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds 
 in the <NUM> per cents . <end>   5.664102124186547
<start> <start> which will not be yours till after your mother 's 
 decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . <end>   6.0151185418996205
<start> <start> " You are too hasty , Sir , " she cried . <end>   3.759162319981162
<start> <start> Let me do it without farther loss of time . <end>   3.6823557255011434
<start> <start> Accept my thanks for 
 the compliment you are paying me . <end>   5.689826924818419
<start> <start> I am very sensible of the honour of 
 your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline 
 them . " 
 
 " I am not now to learn , " replied Mr . Collins , with a formal wave of the 
 hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the 
 man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their 
 favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a 
 third time . <end>   4.635277448955494
<start> <start> I do assure you that I am not 
 one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so 
 daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second 
 time . <end>   4.22638643190079
<start> <start> I am perfectly serious in my refusal . - - You could not make _me_ 
 happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who 
 would make _you_ so . - - Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I 
 am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the 
 situation . " 
 
 " Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , " said Mr . Collins 
 very gravely - - " but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all 
 disapprove of you . <end>   5.740174996958836
<start> <start> In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your 
 feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn 
 estate whenever it falls , without any self - reproach . <end>   3.9328607393719017
<start> <start> If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form 
 of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as 
 may convince you of its being one . " 
 
 " You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your 
 refusal of my addresses is merely words of course . <end>   4.411129960105591
<start> <start> My reasons for 
 believing it are briefly these : - - It does not appear to me that my hand 
 is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would 
 be any other than highly desirable . <end>   4.230296613696724
<start> <start> My situation in life , my connections 
 with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are 
 circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther 
 consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no 
 means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . <end>   4.987376880207871
<start> <start> I would 
 rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . <end>   5.234111580201416
<start> <start> I thank you 
 again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but 
 to accept them is absolutely impossible . <end>   5.9935495207465115
<start> <start> My feelings in every respect 
 forbid it . <end>   3.983683344824468
<start> <start> Can I speak plainer ? <end>   5.777486847197549
<start> <start> Do not consider me now as an elegant 
 female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the 
 truth from her heart . " 
 
 " You are uniformly charming ! " cried he , with an air of awkward 
 gallantry ; " and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express 
 authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of 
 being acceptable . " 
 
 To such perseverance in wilful self - deception Elizabeth would make no 
 reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew ; determined , if he 
 persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering 
 encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered 
 in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could 
 not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female . <end>   4.0052364029550445
<start> <start> CHAPTER XX . 
 
 
 Mr . Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his 
 successful love ; for Mrs . <end>   5.3796698283386535
<start> <start> Bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule 
 to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Elizabeth open the 
 door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she 
 entered the breakfast - room , and congratulated both him and herself in 
 warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . <end>   4.669043551514576
<start> <start> This information , however , startled Mrs . <end>   5.598002991729083
<start> <start> Bennet ; - - she would have been 
 glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage 
 him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe 
 it , and could not help saying so . <end>   5.623058499427078
<start> <start> " But depend upon it , Mr . Collins , " she added , " that Lizzy shall be 
 brought to reason . <end>   4.892090676090284
<start> <start> I will speak to her about it myself directly . <end>   7.115577054705234
<start> <start> She is 
 a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but 
 I will _make_ her know it . " 
 
 " Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , " cried Mr . Collins ; " but if she 
 is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would 
 altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who 
 naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . <end>   5.874489296533229
<start> <start> In every thing else she is as 
 good natured a girl as ever lived . <end>   5.227952037682868
<start> <start> I will go directly to Mr . Bennet , and 
 we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . " 
 
 She would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her 
 husband , called out as she entered the library , 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   5.092934145703992
<start> <start> You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr . Collins , for she vows she will 
 not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and 
 not have _her_ . " 
 
 Mr . Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them 
 on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by 
 her communication . <end>   5.4259521669143655
<start> <start> " I have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had 
 finished her speech . <end>   4.432313873036941
<start> <start> " Of what are you talking ? " 
 
 " Of Mr . Collins and Lizzy . <end>   4.7525832928398515
<start> <start> Lizzy declares she will not have Mr . Collins , 
 and Mr . Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . " 
 
 " And what am I to do on the occasion ? - - It seems an hopeless business . " 
 
 " Speak to Lizzy about it yourself . <end>   4.887010506695439
<start> <start> Tell her that you insist upon her 
 marrying him . " 
 
 " Let her be called down . <end>   5.432495524382863
<start> <start> She shall hear my opinion . " 
 
 Mrs . <end>   5.060536970036436
<start> <start> Bennet rang the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the 
 library . <end>   7.5808973392132675
<start> <start> " Come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared . <end>   7.328795270231879
<start> <start> " I have sent for 
 you on an affair of importance . <end>   4.792539731852219
<start> <start> I understand that Mr . Collins has made 
 you an offer of marriage . <end>   6.276870222294675
<start> <start> Is it true ? " Elizabeth replied that it was . <end>   8.226830984527439
<start> <start> " Very well - - and this offer of marriage you have refused ? " 
 
 " I have , Sir . " 
 
 " Very well . <end>   4.095047511525321
<start> <start> We now come to the point . <end>   12.423773614769225
<start> <start> Your mother insists upon your 
 accepting it . <end>   4.271331147909221
<start> <start> Bennet ? " 
 
 " Yes , or I will never see her again . " 
 
 " An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . <end>   5.25238212325883
<start> <start> From this day you must 
 be a stranger to one of your parents . - - Your mother will never see you 
 again if you do _not_ marry Mr . Collins , and I will never see you again 
 if you _do_ . " 
 
 Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning ; 
 but Mrs . <end>   4.703354682688729
<start> <start> Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the 
 affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed . <end>   5.8853944462495225
<start> <start> " What do you mean , Mr . Bennet , by talking in this way ? <end>   4.974537325409589
<start> <start> You promised me 
 to _insist_ upon her marrying him . " 
 
 " My dear , " replied her husband , " I have two small favours to request . <end>   4.073972299893052
<start> <start> She talked to Elizabeth again and again ; 
 coaxed and threatened her by turns . <end>   3.6337401792673374
<start> <start> She endeavoured to secure Jane in 
 her interest , but Jane with all possible mildness declined 
 interfering ; - - and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and 
 sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks . <end>   3.972902632290958
<start> <start> Though her manner 
 varied however , her determination never did . <end>   4.945918204835226
<start> <start> Mr . Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . <end>   3.3958695861593684
<start> <start> He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin 
 could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other 
 way . <end>   4.149776608600031
<start> <start> His regard for her was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of her 
 deserving her mother 's reproach prevented his feeling any regret . <end>   4.796452513612836
<start> <start> While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend 
 the day with them . <end>   6.739612794583217
<start> <start> Bennet was alone , than she likewise began on 
 the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and entreating 
 her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her 
 family . <end>   5.722414575486389
<start> <start> " Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , 
 " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , 
 nobody feels for my poor nerves . " 
 
 Charlotte 's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth . <end>   5.0081047582529115
<start> <start> " Aye , there she comes , " continued Mrs . <end>   5.51635622549433
<start> <start> I have no pleasure in 
 talking to undutiful children . - - Not that I have much pleasure indeed in 
 talking to any body . <end>   4.909280508190253
<start> <start> People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints 
 can have no great inclination for talking . <end>   3.1311350279002053
<start> <start> Nobody can tell what I 
 suffer ! - - But it is always so . <end>   6.03164606365284
<start> <start> Those who do not complain are never 
 pitied . " 
 
 Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any 
 attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation . <end>   2.723987396241518
<start> <start> She talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till 
 they were joined by Mr . Collins , who entered with an air more stately 
 than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , 
 
 " Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and 
 let Mr . Collins and me have a little conversation together . " 
 
 Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but 
 Lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could ; and Charlotte , 
 detained first by the civility of Mr . Collins , whose inquiries after 
 herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little 
 curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending 
 not to hear . <end>   5.824787422646135
<start> <start> In a doleful voice Mrs . <end>   3.2503397298684624
<start> <start> Bennet thus began the projected 
 conversation . - - " Oh ! <end>   4.647999543031552
<start> <start> Mr . Collins ! " - - 
 
 " My dear Madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point . <end>   5.537477275702536
<start> <start> Far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his 
 displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter . <end>   4.97521995962156
<start> <start> Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my 
 positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I 
 have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the 
 blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . <end>   3.396697054061792
<start> <start> You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your 
 family , my dear Madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your 
 daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and Mr . Bennet the 
 compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . <end>   4.119235939752059
<start> <start> But we are all liable to 
 error . <end>   6.002613419198851
<start> <start> I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . <end>   5.792792410450374
<start> <start> As for the gentleman himself , _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed , not 
 by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by 
 stiffness of manner and resentful silence . <end>   4.641515314158891
<start> <start> He scarcely ever spoke to 
 her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of 
 himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas , whose 
 civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and 
 especially to her friend . <end>   6.455182023775099
<start> <start> The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs . <end>   2.565412750862285
<start> <start> Bennet 's ill humour or ill 
 health . <end>   3.3224891496859437
<start> <start> Elizabeth 
 had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did 
 not appear in the least affected by it . <end>   4.977633466806735
<start> <start> After breakfast , the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr . Wickham 
 were returned , and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball . <end>   5.4753701005113875
<start> <start> " I found , " said he , " as the time drew near , that I had better not meet 
 Mr . Darcy ; - - that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so 
 many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes 
 might arise unpleasant to more than myself . " 
 
 She highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full 
 discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly 
 bestowed on each other , as Wickham and another officer walked back with 
 them to Longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her . <end>   5.909662224439918
<start> <start> His accompanying them was a double advantage ; she felt all the 
 compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an 
 occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . <end>   4.599477657194762
<start> <start> Soon after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet ; it came 
 from Netherfield , and was opened immediately . <end>   5.889599354731555
<start> <start> Jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to 
 join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but 
 Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention 
 even from Wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , 
 than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs . <end>   4.478476662115337
<start> <start> When they 
 had gained their own room , Jane taking out the letter , said , 
 
 " This is from Caroline Bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a 
 good deal . <end>   4.493142068289916
<start> <start> The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are 
 on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . <end>   5.320548596860744
<start> <start> You shall hear what she says . " 
 
 She then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information 
 of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , 
 and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street , where Mr . 
 Hurst had a house . <end>   4.817265989989134
<start> <start> The next was in these words . <end>   6.007307992681682
<start> <start> " I do not pretend to 
 regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my 
 dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many 
 returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean 
 while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most 
 unreserved correspondence . <end>   4.566483666385037
<start> <start> I depend on you for that . " To these high 
 flown expressions , Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of 
 distrust ; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she 
 saw nothing in it really to lament ; it was not to be supposed that their 
 absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr . Bingley 's being there ; and as 
 to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane must soon 
 cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his . <end>   5.7330661060700665
<start> <start> " It is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be 
 able to see your friends before they leave the country . <end>   4.468662806863985
<start> <start> But may we not 
 hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks 
 forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful 
 intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater 
 satisfaction as sisters ? - - Mr . Bingley will not be detained in London by 
 them . " 
 
 " Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into 
 Hertfordshire this winter . <end>   4.038421015427272
<start> <start> I will read it to you - - 
 
 " When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which 
 took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we 
 are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when 
 Charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have 
 determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend 
 his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel . <end>   5.235287765272292
<start> <start> Many of my acquaintance are 
 already there for the winter ; I wish I could hear that you , my dearest 
 friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that I 
 despair . <end>   6.702057231600606
<start> <start> I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in 
 the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux 
 will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of 
 whom we shall deprive you . " 
 
 " It is evident by this , " added Jane , " that he comes back no more this 
 winter . " 
 
 " It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_ . " 
 
 " Why will you think so ? <end>   4.152695333616505
<start> <start> It must be his own doing . - - He is his own master . <end>   8.325195156081458
<start> <start> But you do not know _all_ . <end>   5.575735946827735
<start> <start> I _will_ read you the passage which 
 particularly hurts me . <end>   3.6216491380804947
<start> <start> I will have no reserves from _you_ . " " Mr . Darcy 
 is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , _we_ are 
 scarcely less eager to meet her again . <end>   4.591635089612358
<start> <start> I really do not think Georgiana 
 Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the 
 affection she inspires in Louisa and myself , is heightened into 
 something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of 
 her being hereafter our sister . <end>   4.5376262439431265
<start> <start> I do not know whether I ever before 
 mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the 
 country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them 
 unreasonable . <end>   4.631871991720413
<start> <start> My brother admires her greatly already , he will have 
 frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her 
 relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister 's 
 partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most 
 capable of engaging any woman 's heart . <end>   4.244120879270527
<start> <start> With all these circumstances to 
 favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest 
 Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness 
 of so many ? " 
 
 " What think you of _this_ sentence , my dear Lizzy ? " - - said Jane as she 
 finished it . <end>   5.05421796695984
<start> <start> " Is it not clear enough ? - - Does it not expressly declare 
 that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she 
 is perfectly convinced of her brother 's indifference , and that if she 
 suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ! ) to 
 put me on my guard ? <end>   4.600582700598842
<start> <start> Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? " 
 
 " Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . - - Will you hear it ? " 
 
 " Most willingly . " 
 
 " You shall have it in few words . <end>   4.013590317423964
<start> <start> Miss Bingley sees that her brother is 
 in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy . <end>   7.855486734244366
<start> <start> She follows him to 
 town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he 
 does not care about you . " 
 
 Jane shook her head . <end>   5.286537196463761
<start> <start> " Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . - - No one who has ever seen you 
 together , can doubt his affection . <end>   7.075378656977684
<start> <start> Miss Bingley I am sure cannot . <end>   8.17897726912943
<start> <start> Could she have seen half as much love in Mr . Darcy 
 for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . <end>   5.892328582928057
<start> <start> But the case is 
 this . <end>   9.729437611134792
<start> <start> We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the 
 more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that 
 when there has been _one_ intermarriage , she may have less trouble in 
 achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I 
 dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . <end>   6.1879318653178865
<start> <start> But , 
 my dearest Jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley 
 tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest 
 degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on 
 Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of 
 being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . " 
 
 " If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , " replied Jane , " your 
 representation of all this , might make me quite easy . <end>   4.923551584294717
<start> <start> But I know the 
 foundation is unjust . <end>   7.12864952724929
<start> <start> Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any 
 one ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived 
 herself . " 
 
 " That is right . - - You could not have started a more happy idea , since you 
 will not take comfort in mine . <end>   4.534415104178963
<start> <start> Believe her to be deceived by all means . <end>   6.692277615715797
<start> <start> You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . " 
 
 " But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in 
 accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry 
 elsewhere ? " 
 
 " You must decide for yourself , " said Elizabeth , " and if upon mature 
 deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is 
 more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by 
 all means to refuse him . " 
 
 " How can you talk so ? " - - said Jane faintly smiling , - - " You must know that 
 though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could 
 not hesitate . " 
 
 " I did not think you would ; - - and that being the case , I cannot consider 
 your situation with much compassion . " 
 
 " But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be 
 required . <end>   4.532834414159793
<start> <start> A thousand things may arise in six months ! " 
 
 The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost 
 contempt . <end>   3.3665169150852488
<start> <start> It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline 's 
 interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those 
 wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man 
 so totally independent of every one . <end>   4.438870329215764
<start> <start> She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on 
 the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . <end>   5.051335879241627
<start> <start> Jane 's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , 
 though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that 
 Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart . <end>   5.1940901775165145
<start> <start> They agreed that Mrs . <end>   4.8766837877501645
<start> <start> Bennet should only hear of the departure of the 
 family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman 's conduct ; 
 but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , 
 and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen 
 to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together . <end>   4.531000171275414
<start> <start> After 
 lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking 
 that Mr . Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn , 
 and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though 
 he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have 
 two full courses . <end>   5.262414248854735
<start> <start> " It keeps him in good 
 humour , " said she , " and I am more obliged to you than I can express . " 
 Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and 
 that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . <end>   6.049761074777986
<start> <start> Such was Miss Lucas 's scheme ; and appearances were so 
 favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost 
 sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon . <end>   4.689316856943068
<start> <start> But here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his 
 character , for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next 
 morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw 
 himself at her feet . <end>   4.663006870809357
<start> <start> He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , 
 from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to 
 conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known 
 till its success could be known likewise ; for though feeling almost 
 secure , and with reason , for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , 
 he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday . <end>   4.90938693655141
<start> <start> His 
 reception however was of the most flattering kind . <end>   5.254153274435213
<start> <start> Miss Lucas perceived 
 him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly 
 set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . <end>   5.167027989144219
<start> <start> But little had she dared 
 to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there . <end>   4.3145314848307725
<start> <start> In as short a time as Mr . Collins 's long speeches would allow , every 
 thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they 
 entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was 
 to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be 
 waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his 
 happiness . <end>   5.236561150907186
<start> <start> The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must 
 guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its 
 continuance ; and Miss Lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and 
 disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that 
 establishment were gained . <end>   4.1096030549084945
<start> <start> Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent ; 
 and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . <end>   4.12230569649815
<start> <start> Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more 
 interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer 
 Mr . Bennet was likely to live ; and Sir William gave it as his decided 
 opinion , that whenever Mr . Collins should be in possession of the 
 Longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife 
 should make their appearance at St . James 's . <end>   4.679717774401377
<start> <start> The whole family in short 
 were properly overjoyed on the occasion . <end>   4.870578250360338
<start> <start> The younger girls formed hopes 
 of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have 
 done ; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte 's 
 dying an old maid . <end>   3.6239488121621135
<start> <start> She had 
 gained her point , and had time to consider of it . <end>   5.373142551199616
<start> <start> Her reflections were 
 in general satisfactory . <end>   7.59703626652404
<start> <start> Mr . Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor 
 agreeable ; his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be 
 imaginary . <end>   4.686225448470928
<start> <start> But still he would be her husband . - - Without thinking highly 
 either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it 
 was the only honourable provision for well - educated young women of small 
 fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their 
 pleasantest preservative from want . <end>   3.882966050996334
<start> <start> The least agreeable 
 circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to 
 Elizabeth Bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other 
 person . <end>   5.542591836388862
<start> <start> Elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her ; and though 
 her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such 
 disapprobation . <end>   6.336471866128645
<start> <start> She resolved to give her the information herself , and 
 therefore charged Mr . Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner , 
 to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . <end>   5.914478763228159
<start> <start> A promise 
 of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept 
 without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst 
 forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some 
 ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great 
 self - denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love . <end>   3.9092336949286435
<start> <start> As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the 
 family , the ceremony of leave - taking was performed when the ladies moved 
 for the night ; and Mrs . <end>   5.206411541451637
<start> <start> Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said 
 how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again , whenever his 
 other engagements might allow him to visit them . <end>   5.397818034868118
<start> <start> Risk any thing rather than her 
 displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us 
 again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , 
 and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence . " 
 
 " Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such 
 affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive 
 from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of 
 your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire . <end>   4.73412599446381
<start> <start> As for my fair cousins , 
 though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall 
 now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting 
 my cousin Elizabeth . " 
 
 With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew ; all of them equally 
 surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . <end>   3.735185736485564
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet wished 
 to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of 
 her younger girls , and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . <end>   6.258887341360399
<start> <start> She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others ; there was a 
 solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no 
 means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and 
 improve himself by such an example as her 's , he might become a very 
 agreeable companion . <end>   4.914901080790598
<start> <start> But on the following morning , every hope of this 
 kind was done away . <end>   6.946989251622554
<start> <start> Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a 
 private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before . <end>   4.854133237757275
<start> <start> The possibility of Mr . Collins 's fancying himself in love with her 
 friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two ; but 
 that Charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from 
 possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her 
 astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the 
 bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , 
 
 " Engaged to Mr . Collins ! <end>   5.350015830545403
<start> <start> " I see what you are feeling , " replied Charlotte , - - " you must be 
 surprised , very much surprised , - - so lately as Mr . Collins was wishing to 
 marry you . <end>   5.978422422878737
<start> <start> But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you 
 will be satisfied with what I have done . <end>   9.197341987459934
<start> <start> I am not romantic you know . <end>   4.070457223688948
<start> <start> I 
 never was . <end>   5.926007518421147
<start> <start> It 
 was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so 
 unsuitable a match . <end>   6.040591973127292
<start> <start> The strangeness of Mr . Collins 's making two offers 
 of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being 
 now accepted . <end>   3.954938673617366
<start> <start> Charlotte the wife of Mr . Collins , 
 was a most humiliating picture ! - - And to the pang of a friend disgracing 
 herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction 
 that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot 
 she had chosen . <end>   5.1947553737631775
<start> <start> CHAPTER XXIII . 
 
 
 Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what 
 she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , 
 when Sir William Lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to 
 announce her engagement to the family . <end>   4.782185214743211
<start> <start> With many compliments to them , 
 and much self - gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the 
 houses , he unfolded the matter , - - to an audience not merely wondering , 
 but incredulous ; for Mrs . <end>   5.106074374076861
<start> <start> Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? - - Do not you know 
 that Mr . Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? " 
 
 Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne 
 without anger such treatment ; but Sir William 's good breeding carried 
 him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the 
 truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the 
 most forbearing courtesy . <end>   4.922315426476568
<start> <start> Elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant 
 a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by 
 mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself ; and 
 endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , 
 by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William , in which she 
 was readily joined by Jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the 
 happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character 
 of Mr . Collins , and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London . <end>   5.308820721440884
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while 
 Sir William remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings 
 found a rapid vent . <end>   4.278762567408001
<start> <start> Two 
 inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole ; one , that 
 Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief ; and the other , that 
 she herself had been barbarously used by them all ; and on these two 
 points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . <end>   4.743490669656019
<start> <start> Kitty and 
 Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Mr . Collins was only a 
 clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news 
 to spread at Meryton . <end>   4.762606688295259
<start> <start> Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she 
 called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , 
 though Mrs . <end>   5.168300523035877
<start> <start> Bennet 's sour looks and ill - natured remarks might have been 
 enough to drive happiness away . <end>   3.4750981016058
<start> <start> Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them 
 mutually silent on the subject ; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no 
 real confidence could ever subsist between them again . <end>   3.711927062503204
<start> <start> Her 
 disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her 
 sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could 
 never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as 
 Bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return . <end>   4.266116191750228
<start> <start> Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting 
 the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again . <end>   5.6600892834928915
<start> <start> The promised 
 letter of thanks from Mr . Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their 
 father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a 
 twelvemonth 's abode in the family might have prompted . <end>   4.489161976593071
<start> <start> After discharging 
 his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many 
 rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection 
 of their amiable neighbour , Miss Lucas , and then explained that it was 
 merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready 
 to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn , whither 
 he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight ; for Lady Catherine , 
 he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take 
 place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable 
 argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him 
 the happiest of men . <end>   4.790221906028885
<start> <start> Mr . Collins 's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of 
 pleasure to Mrs . <end>   4.474043449460548
<start> <start> On the contrary she was as much disposed to 
 complain of it as her husband . - - It was very strange that he should come 
 to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge ; it was also very inconvenient 
 and exceedingly troublesome . - - She hated having visitors in the house 
 while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the 
 most disagreeable . <end>   5.520070657678776
<start> <start> Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs . <end>   3.3116643805899764
<start> <start> Bennet , and they 
 gave way only to the greater distress of Mr . Bingley 's continued 
 absence . <end>   5.837490573953784
<start> <start> Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject . <end>   3.4135566338158196
<start> <start> Day after 
 day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the 
 report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to 
 Netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed Mrs . <end>   4.429727433918061
<start> <start> Even Elizabeth began to fear - - not that Bingley was indifferent - - but that 
 his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . <end>   5.589002943616859
<start> <start> Unwilling as she 
 was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane 's happiness , and so 
 dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its 
 frequently recurring . <end>   5.6082105440955
<start> <start> But as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an 
 hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley , express her 
 impatience for his arrival , or even require Jane to confess that if he 
 did not come back , she should think herself very ill used . <end>   4.680328546176429
<start> <start> It needed all 
 Jane 's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable 
 tranquillity . <end>   3.052755676640577
<start> <start> He was too happy , however , to need much attention ; 
 and luckily for the others , the business of love - making relieved them 
 from a great deal of his company . <end>   5.587702571626406
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet was really in a most pitiable state . <end>   7.3895159768377425
<start> <start> The very mention of any 
 thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and 
 wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of . <end>   3.7369698798086204
<start> <start> The sight of 
 Miss Lucas was odious to her . <end>   8.086747802090667
<start> <start> As her successor in that house , she 
 regarded her with jealous abhorrence . <end>   4.887941772837714
<start> <start> Whenever Charlotte came to see 
 them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession ; and 
 whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr . Collins , was convinced that 
 they were talking of the Longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself 
 and her daughters out of the house , as soon as Mr . Bennet were dead . <end>   6.075352736484203
<start> <start> She 
 complained bitterly of all this to her husband . <end>   5.964885199708398
<start> <start> Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor . " 
 
 This was not very consoling to Mrs . <end>   3.660583567763061
<start> <start> Bennet , and , therefore , instead of 
 making any answer , she went on as before , 
 
 " I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate . <end>   6.9547872686142735
<start> <start> If it was 
 not for the entail I should not mind it . " 
 
 " What should not you mind ? " 
 
 " I should not mind any thing at all . " 
 
 " Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such 
 insensibility . " 
 
 " I never can be thankful , Mr . Bennet , for any thing about the entail . <end>   4.968734639322332
<start> <start> How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from 
 one 's own daughters I cannot understand ; and all for the sake of Mr . 
 Collins too ! - - Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else ? " 
 
 " I leave it to yourself to determine , " said Mr . Bennet . <end>   4.685269960715233

 CHAPTER I . 
 
 
 Miss Bingley 's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt . <end>   6.053609413598137
<start> <start> The very first 
 sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for 
 the winter , and concluded with her brother 's regret at not having had 
 time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left 
 the country . <end>   5.0653928223269995
<start> <start> Hope was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of 
 the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the 
 writer , that could give her any comfort . <end>   5.2955523597450975
<start> <start> Miss Darcy 's praise occupied 
 the chief of it . <end>   5.892604611854733
<start> <start> Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline 
 boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict 
 the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former 
 letter . <end>   4.8768101681938765
<start> <start> She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother 's being an 
 inmate of Mr . Darcy 's house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of 
 the latter with regard to new furniture . <end>   4.406747074113548
<start> <start> That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she 
 had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she 
 could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness 
 of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave 
 of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to 
 the caprice of their inclinations . <end>   6.37237006844878
<start> <start> It was a subject , in short , on 
 which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . <end>   7.665607735618258
<start> <start> A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to 
 Elizabeth ; but at last on Mrs . <end>   6.215350674981036
<start> <start> Bennet 's leaving them together , after a 
 longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could 
 not help saying , 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   4.335114525815833
<start> <start> that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no 
 idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . <end>   4.7583650830933815
<start> <start> But I 
 will not repine . <end>   8.572289236996278
<start> <start> It cannot last long . <end>   4.418563318149385
<start> <start> He will be forgot , and we shall 
 all be as we were before . " 
 
 Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said 
 nothing . <end>   5.631961190478404
<start> <start> " You doubt me , " cried Jane , slightly colouring ; " indeed you have no 
 reason . <end>   6.1039886190363
<start> <start> He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my 
 acquaintance , but that is all . <end>   6.63043036746309
<start> <start> I have nothing either to hope or fear , 
 and nothing to reproach him with . <end>   4.898846528449059
<start> <start> Thank God ! <end>   9.956911683913217
<start> <start> A 
 little time therefore . - - I shall certainly try to get the better . " 
 
 With a stronger voice she soon added , " I have this comfort immediately , 
 that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it 
 has done no harm to any one but myself . " 
 
 " My dear Jane ! " exclaimed Elizabeth , " you are too good . <end>   4.659879111592104
<start> <start> Your sweetness 
 and disinterestedness are really angelic ; I do not know what to say to 
 you . <end>   4.99480488530686
<start> <start> I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you 
 deserve . " 
 
 Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back 
 the praise on her sister 's warm affection . <end>   5.142355849390335
<start> <start> " Nay , " said Elizabeth , " this is not fair . <end>   5.747616426590572
<start> <start> _You_ wish to think all the 
 world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body . <end>   7.086982640776804
<start> <start> Do not be 
 afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your 
 privilege of universal good will . <end>   4.656587793351477
<start> <start> You need not . <end>   10.378910253237573
<start> <start> There are few people 
 whom I really love , and still fewer of whom I think well . <end>   5.56740680664155
<start> <start> I have met with two instances lately ; one I will not mention ; 
 the other is Charlotte 's marriage . <end>   5.459610887818749
<start> <start> It is unaccountable ! <end>   6.728063484930576
<start> <start> in every view it 
 is unaccountable ! " 
 
 " My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . <end>   5.3023675853955465
<start> <start> They will 
 ruin your happiness . <end>   4.520396102876261
<start> <start> You do not make allowance enough for difference of 
 situation and temper . <end>   5.244460086539055
<start> <start> Consider Mr . Collins 's respectability , and 
 Charlotte 's prudent , steady character . <end>   5.150533636784322
<start> <start> Remember that she is one of a 
 large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be 
 ready to believe , for every body 's sake , that she may feel something 
 like regard and esteem for our cousin . " 
 
 " To oblige you , I would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else 
 could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that 
 Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her 
 understanding , than I now do of her heart . <end>   5.9020166743201905
<start> <start> My dear Jane , Mr . Collins is 
 a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well 
 as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who marries 
 him , cannot have a proper way of thinking . <end>   5.4450449124795846
<start> <start> You shall not defend her , 
 though it is Charlotte Lucas . <end>   8.726088362757668
<start> <start> You shall not , for the sake of one 
 individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor 
 endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and 
 insensibility of danger , security for happiness . " 
 
 " I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied 
 Jane , " and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy 
 together . <end>   3.7386487210085146
<start> <start> But enough of this . <end>   9.034653262342061
<start> <start> You alluded to something else . <end>   4.339201259871301
<start> <start> You 
 mentioned _two_ instances . <end>   3.876226303890554
<start> <start> I cannot misunderstand you , but I intreat 
 you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame , and 
 saying your opinion of him is sunk . <end>   4.883334414573927
<start> <start> We must not expect a lively young man 
 to be always so guarded and circumspect . <end>   4.5742915430905144
<start> <start> Women fancy admiration means more than 
 it does . " 
 
 " And men take care that they should . " 
 
 " If it is designedly done , they cannot be justified ; but I have no idea 
 of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . " 
 
 " I am far from attributing any part of Mr . Bingley 's conduct to design , " 
 said Elizabeth ; " but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others 
 unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . <end>   4.985118887440816
<start> <start> Thoughtlessness , 
 want of attention to other people 's feelings , and want of resolution , 
 will do the business . " 
 
 " And do you impute it to either of those ? " 
 
 " Yes ; to the last . <end>   6.396907521225114
<start> <start> Stop me whilst you can . " 
 
 " You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him . " 
 
 " Yes , in conjunction with his friend . " 
 
 " I cannot believe it . <end>   4.151662734582101
<start> <start> Why should they try to influence him ? <end>   4.050363960928119
<start> <start> They can 
 only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can 
 secure it . " 
 
 " Your first position is false . <end>   4.6027487998702
<start> <start> They may wish many things besides his 
 happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they 
 may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great 
 connections , and pride . " 
 
 " Beyond a doubt , they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , " replied Jane ; 
 " but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . <end>   4.8396896523325275
<start> <start> They have 
 known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love 
 her better . <end>   4.198502118626064
<start> <start> If they believed him attached to me , they would not try 
 to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . <end>   5.962906188622395
<start> <start> Do not distress me by the idea . <end>   6.892557808611291
<start> <start> Let me take it 
 in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . " 
 
 Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Mr . Bingley 's 
 name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . <end>   6.042043887876647
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no 
 more , and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account 
 for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it 
 with less perplexity . <end>   4.814676798276443
<start> <start> Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what 
 she did not believe herself , that his attentions to Jane had been merely 
 the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw 
 her no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at 
 the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . <end>   6.350423141094159
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Mr . Bennet treated the matter differently . <end>   4.998602903076909
<start> <start> " So , Lizzy , " said he one day , 
 " your sister is crossed in love I find . <end>   6.278923701017239
<start> <start> I congratulate her . <end>   8.112028968258755
<start> <start> Next to 
 being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . <end>   8.916238646206006
<start> <start> It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among 
 her companions . <end>   6.656782976746325
<start> <start> When is your turn to come ? <end>   7.08868167155736
<start> <start> You will hardly bear to be 
 long outdone by Jane . <end>   4.327222204994097
<start> <start> Now is your time . <end>   7.0437430118879725
<start> <start> Here are officers enough at 
 Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . <end>   4.6820066629786385
<start> <start> Let Wickham 
 be _your_ man . <end>   6.316973542778873
<start> <start> He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . " 
 
 " Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . <end>   4.39143408240502
<start> <start> We must not 
 all expect Jane 's good fortune . " 
 
 " True , " said Mr . Bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of 
 that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always 
 make the most of it . " 
 
 Mr . Wickham 's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , 
 which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn 
 family . <end>   4.7069446782661
<start> <start> They saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now 
 added that of general unreserve . <end>   5.769014983651058
<start> <start> Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any 
 extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of 
 Hertfordshire ; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for 
 allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes - - but by everybody else 
 Mr . Darcy was condemned as the worst of men . <end>   4.3121615605278905
<start> <start> CHAPTER II . 
 
 
 After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , Mr . 
 Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of 
 Saturday . <end>   4.0451500839569485
<start> <start> The pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his 
 side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason 
 to hope , that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire , the day 
 would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men . <end>   5.439217688186504
<start> <start> He took leave 
 of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before ; wished 
 his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father 
 another letter of thanks . <end>   4.408729055794935
<start> <start> On the following Monday , Mrs . <end>   4.340839501426289
<start> <start> Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her 
 brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the Christmas at 
 Longbourn . <end>   5.258040221054456
<start> <start> Mr . Gardiner was a sensible , gentleman - like man , greatly 
 superior to his sister , as well by nature as education . <end>   4.423114609296208
<start> <start> The Netherfield 
 ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by 
 trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well 
 bred and agreeable . <end>   5.557877256848755
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Gardiner , who was several years younger than 
 Mrs . <end>   3.8537382270068403
<start> <start> Bennet and Mrs . <end>   5.38081113392567
<start> <start> Between the 
 two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular 
 regard . <end>   5.660143229755157
<start> <start> They had frequently been staying with her in town . <end>   4.868609807783582
<start> <start> The first part of Mrs . <end>   5.397732496401884
<start> <start> Gardiner 's business on her arrival , was to 
 distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions . <end>   3.8505783074583126
<start> <start> When this was 
 done , she had a less active part to play . <end>   7.211899566598192
<start> <start> It became her turn to listen . <end>   5.279417310229754
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . <end>   5.406154320866703
<start> <start> They 
 had all been very ill - used since she last saw her sister . <end>   4.341584488931748
<start> <start> Two of her 
 girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing 
 in it . <end>   8.848802587854264
<start> <start> Oh , sister ! <end>   9.554360085031739
<start> <start> it is very hard to think 
 that she might have been Mr . Collins 's wife by this time , had not it 
 been for her own perverseness . <end>   7.67065985992484
<start> <start> He made her an offer in this very room , 
 and she refused him . <end>   6.410135211993596
<start> <start> The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have 
 a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as 
 much entailed as ever . <end>   8.201160944802638
<start> <start> The Lucases are very artful people indeed , 
 sister . <end>   6.114985418741851
<start> <start> They are all for what they can get . <end>   7.038268555930162
<start> <start> I am sorry to say it of 
 them , but so it is . <end>   9.191350156622846
<start> <start> It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted 
 so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves 
 before anybody else . <end>   4.745870643469978
<start> <start> However , your coming just at this time is the 
 greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of 
 long sleeves . " 
 
 Mrs . <end>   5.421616856391493
<start> <start> Gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in 
 the course of Jane and Elizabeth 's correspondence with her , made her 
 sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the 
 conversation . <end>   7.055441287569123
<start> <start> When alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject . <end>   4.805187379416282
<start> <start> " It 
 seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , " said she . <end>   4.493845256924504
<start> <start> But these things happen so often ! <end>   4.271016337956988
<start> <start> A young man , such 
 as you describe Mr . Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl 
 for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets 
 her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent . " 
 
 " An excellent consolation in its way , " said Elizabeth , " but it will not 
 do for _us_ . <end>   5.093546493571896
<start> <start> We do not suffer by _accident_ . <end>   4.721876982833069
<start> <start> It is as 
 often applied to feelings which arise from an half - hour 's acquaintance , 
 as to a real , strong attachment . <end>   5.179513645435175
<start> <start> Pray , how _violent was_ Mr . Bingley 's 
 love ? " 
 
 " I never saw a more promising inclination . <end>   4.395217719023194
<start> <start> He was growing quite 
 inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . <end>   4.631761090923106
<start> <start> Every time 
 they met , it was more decided and remarkable . <end>   5.829432744694179
<start> <start> At his own ball he 
 offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I 
 spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer . <end>   5.5748873483899635
<start> <start> Could there be 
 finer symptoms ? <end>   7.055879339873217
<start> <start> Is not general incivility the very essence of love ? " 
 
 " Oh , yes ! - - of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . <end>   4.666736318329193
<start> <start> Poor 
 Jane ! <end>   12.596212768039509
<start> <start> It had better have happened to _you_ , Lizzy ; you 
 would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . <end>   6.237753664334406
<start> <start> But do you think she 
 would be prevailed on to go back with us ? <end>   5.517404745598417
<start> <start> Change of scene might be of 
 service - - and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as 
 anything . " 
 
 Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded 
 of her sister 's ready acquiescence . <end>   5.40598404185778
<start> <start> Gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to 
 this young man will influence her . <end>   5.262933673721203
<start> <start> We live in so different a part of 
 town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go 
 out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , 
 unless he really comes to see her . " 
 
 " And _that_ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his 
 friend , and Mr . Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a 
 part of London ! <end>   5.466059495719809
<start> <start> My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? <end>   6.625775448376127
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy may 
 perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would 
 hardly think a month 's ablution enough to cleanse him from its 
 impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , Mr . Bingley 
 never stirs without him . " 
 
 " So much the better . <end>   3.56581566553136
<start> <start> But does not Jane 
 correspond with the sister ? <end>   7.608910961516643
<start> <start> _She_ will not be able to help calling . " 
 
 " She will drop the acquaintance entirely . " 
 
 But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this 
 point , as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley 's being 
 withheld from seeing Jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which 
 convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely 
 hopeless . <end>   4.7660366905512594
<start> <start> It was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that 
 his affection might be re - animated , and the influence of his friends 
 successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane 's 
 attractions . <end>   5.649644186296891
<start> <start> Miss Bennet accepted her aunt 's invitation with pleasure ; and the 
 Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she 
 hoped that , by Caroline 's not living in the same house with her brother , 
 she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of 
 seeing him . <end>   5.9856708925389315
<start> <start> The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn ; and what with the Philipses , 
 the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its 
 engagement . <end>   6.9274944801320695
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment 
 of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family 
 dinner . <end>   5.570685270200572
<start> <start> Gardiner , rendered suspicious by Elizabeth 's 
 warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . <end>   3.6961346212345956
<start> <start> Without supposing 
 them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference 
 of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy ; and she 
 resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left 
 Hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such 
 an attachment . <end>   6.761177807285108
<start> <start> To Mrs . <end>   8.661849529725878
<start> <start> Gardiner , Wickham had one means of affording pleasure , 
 unconnected with his general powers . <end>   4.963262986139733
<start> <start> They had , therefore , many 
 acquaintance in common ; and , though Wickham had been little there since 
 the death of Darcy 's father , five years before , it was yet in his power 
 to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had 
 been in the way of procuring . <end>   5.899057485002828
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> In comparing her recollection of Pemberley , with the 
 minute description which Wickham could give , and in bestowing her 
 tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was 
 delighting both him and herself . <end>   4.151744429482903
<start> <start> On being made acquainted with the 
 present Mr . Darcy 's treatment of him , she tried to remember something of 
 that gentleman 's reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree 
 with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard 
 Mr . Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill - natured 
 boy . <end>   4.46992827310198
<start> <start> CHAPTER III . 
 
 
 Mrs . <end>   5.481434340446152
<start> <start> Gardiner 's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on 
 the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone ; after 
 honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : 
 
 " You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you 
 are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking 
 openly . <end>   4.091309251623333
<start> <start> Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . <end>   10.623228929799376
<start> <start> I have nothing to say against 
 _him_ ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he 
 ought to have , I should think you could not do better . <end>   7.222019610621608
<start> <start> But as it is - - you 
 must not let your fancy run away with you . <end>   6.897474477438589
<start> <start> You have sense , and we all 
 expect you to use it . <end>   5.3697496780420195
<start> <start> Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and 
 good conduct , I am sure . <end>   5.425378890002199
<start> <start> You must not disappoint your father . " 
 
 " My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . " 
 
 " Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . " 
 
 " Well , then , you need not be under any alarm . <end>   4.53185080514783
<start> <start> He shall not be in love with me , if I 
 can prevent it . " 
 
 " Elizabeth , you are not serious now . " 
 
 " I beg your pardon . <end>   5.5962517501079745
<start> <start> I will try again . <end>   4.8862136845802135
<start> <start> At present I am not in love with 
 Mr . Wickham ; no , I certainly am not . <end>   8.3427927807098
<start> <start> But he is , beyond all comparison , 
 the most agreeable man I ever saw - - and if he becomes really attached to 
 me - - I believe it will be better that he should not . <end>   6.736756094031991
<start> <start> I see the imprudence 
 of it . - - Oh ! <end>   7.954413157303109
<start> <start> _that_ abominable Mr . Darcy ! - - My father 's opinion of me does 
 me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to forfeit it . <end>   5.753630263640752
<start> <start> My 
 father , however , is partial to Mr . Wickham . <end>   7.000137119712059
<start> <start> In short , my dear aunt , I 
 should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but 
 since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are 
 seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into 
 engagements with each other , how can I promise to be wiser than so many 
 of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it 
 would be wisdom to resist ? <end>   4.672529803633743
<start> <start> All that I can promise you , therefore , is not 
 to be in a hurry . <end>   9.935310504785411
<start> <start> I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first 
 object . <end>   4.198533685255579
<start> <start> When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing . <end>   6.378361232525284
<start> <start> At least , you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him . " 
 
 " As I did the other day , " said Elizabeth , with a conscious smile ; " very 
 true , it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_ . <end>   4.544637057304704
<start> <start> You know my mother 's ideas as to the 
 necessity of constant company for her friends . <end>   4.95480315403739
<start> <start> But really , and upon my 
 honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now , I hope you 
 are satisfied . " 
 
 Her aunt assured her that she was ; and Elizabeth having thanked her for 
 the kindness of her hints , they parted ; a wonderful instance of advice 
 being given on such a point , without being resented . <end>   6.294789071000032
<start> <start> Mr . Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted 
 by the Gardiners and Jane ; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases , 
 his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs . <end>   5.294323285952401
<start> <start> Bennet . <end>   10.318399796512947
<start> <start> His marriage was 
 now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think 
 it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill - natured tone that 
 she " _wished_ they might be happy . " Thursday was to be the wedding day , 
 and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit ; and when she rose 
 to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother 's ungracious and 
 reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her 
 out of the room . <end>   5.68562916072587
<start> <start> As they went down stairs together , Charlotte said , 
 
 " I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . " 
 
 " _That_ you certainly shall . " 
 
 " And I have another favour to ask . <end>   3.826832340764033
<start> <start> Will you come and see me ? " 
 
 " We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . " 
 
 " I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . <end>   4.956210067312141
<start> <start> " My father and Maria are to come to me in March , " added Charlotte , " and 
 I hope you will consent to be of the party . <end>   7.209512272893079
<start> <start> Indeed , Eliza , you will be 
 as welcome to me as either of them . " 
 
 The wedding took place ; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from 
 the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the 
 subject as usual . <end>   5.4942683881832695
<start> <start> Elizabeth soon heard from her friend ; and their 
 correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been ; that it 
 should be equally unreserved was impossible . <end>   5.050447954931554
<start> <start> Elizabeth could never 
 address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , 
 and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the 
 sake of what had been , rather than what was . <end>   5.604262040014078
<start> <start> She 
 wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing 
 which she could not praise . <end>   4.481405281811539
<start> <start> The house , furniture , neighbourhood , and 
 roads , were all to her taste , and Lady Catherine 's behaviour was most 
 friendly and obliging . <end>   6.249234297968513
<start> <start> It was Mr . Collins 's picture of Hunsford and 
 Rosings rationally softened ; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait 
 for her own visit there , to know the rest . <end>   6.1446019180332945
<start> <start> Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their 
 safe arrival in London ; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped it 
 would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys . <end>   6.465930774494584
<start> <start> Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience 
 generally is . <end>   3.6549539972548692
<start> <start> She accounted for it , however , by supposing that 
 her last letter to her friend from Longbourn , had by some accident been 
 lost . <end>   7.73115425272051
<start> <start> I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . <end>   4.03631077032957
<start> <start> I enquired after their brother , of course . <end>   6.750668009035763
<start> <start> I found that 
 Miss Darcy was expected to dinner . <end>   12.10725644938479
<start> <start> I wish I could see her . <end>   6.196552890957676
<start> <start> My visit was 
 not long , as Caroline and Mrs . <end>   6.994843082140513
<start> <start> Hurst were going out . <end>   6.067761331721692
<start> <start> I dare say I shall 
 soon see them here . " 
 
 Elizabeth shook her head over this letter . <end>   4.00182006737827
<start> <start> It convinced her , that 
 accident only could discover to Mr . Bingley her sister 's being in town . <end>   4.925557275115876
<start> <start> Four weeks passed away , and Jane saw nothing of him . <end>   6.900179718301234
<start> <start> She endeavoured to 
 persuade herself that she did not regret it ; but she could no longer be 
 blind to Miss Bingley 's inattention . <end>   6.046278680467536
<start> <start> After waiting at home every morning 
 for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the 
 visitor did at last appear ; but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , 
 the alteration of her manner , would allow Jane to deceive herself no 
 longer . <end>   5.973753281133036
<start> <start> I do not at 
 all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but 
 if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should 
 be deceived again . <end>   6.154038595137127
<start> <start> Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; 
 and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time . <end>   3.80910142965721
<start> <start> When 
 she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; 
 she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said 
 not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so 
 altered a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly 
 resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . <end>   6.16159226738958
<start> <start> I pity , though I 
 cannot help blaming her . <end>   5.801211497930534
<start> <start> She was very wrong in singling me out as 
 she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on 
 her side . <end>   4.840377310539933
<start> <start> But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been 
 acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her 
 brother is the cause of it . <end>   7.562159662400841
<start> <start> He knows of my 
 being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and 
 yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to 
 persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . <end>   5.547073544825657
<start> <start> If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should 
 be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of 
 duplicity in all this . <end>   5.64096218683005
<start> <start> But I will endeavour to banish every painful 
 thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , 
 and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . <end>   5.281472638717587
<start> <start> Let me hear 
 from you very soon . <end>   4.5916962570494535
<start> <start> Miss Bingley said something of his never 
 returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not 
 with any certainty . <end>   8.102000407033252
<start> <start> We had better not mention it . <end>   5.207326178872782
<start> <start> I am extremely 
 glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at 
 Hunsford . <end>   4.124015128366525
<start> <start> Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . <end>   9.12711916331614
<start> <start> I am 
 sure you will be very comfortable there . <end>   5.245085219833107
<start> <start> " Your 's , & c . " 
 
 This letter gave Elizabeth some pain ; but her spirits returned as she 
 considered that Jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least . <end>   3.3892196189539403
<start> <start> All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . <end>   5.14758111957966
<start> <start> She would not 
 even wish for any renewal of his attentions . <end>   7.528189512820697
<start> <start> His character sunk on every 
 review of it ; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible 
 advantage to Jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr . 
 Darcy 's sister , as , by Wickham 's account , she would make him abundantly 
 regret what he had thrown away . <end>   5.2341073385618
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise 
 concerning that gentleman , and required information ; and Elizabeth had 
 such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to 
 herself . <end>   5.103710091760707
<start> <start> His apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , 
 he was the admirer of some one else . <end>   4.2632129181953555
<start> <start> Elizabeth was watchful enough to 
 see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . <end>   6.237607259357249
<start> <start> Her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied 
 with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice , had fortune 
 permitted it . <end>   4.216166902459083
<start> <start> The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most 
 remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself 
 agreeable ; but Elizabeth , less clear - sighted perhaps in his case than 
 in Charlotte 's , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . <end>   5.272356620275144
<start> <start> Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to 
 suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was 
 ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very 
 sincerely wish him happy . <end>   4.6787217223413196
<start> <start> But my feelings are not only cordial 
 towards _him_ ; they are even impartial towards Miss King . <end>   3.425063418418577
<start> <start> I cannot find 
 out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think 
 her a very good sort of girl . <end>   6.495203637887029
<start> <start> There can be no love in all this . <end>   5.377287867865762
<start> <start> My 
 watchfulness has been effectual ; and though I should certainly be a more 
 interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love 
 with him , I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance . <end>   5.575762159269243
<start> <start> Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly . <end>   2.777224307826858
<start> <start> Kitty and Lydia take 
 his defection much more to heart than I do . <end>   5.518913008024064
<start> <start> They are young in the ways 
 of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that 
 handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the 
 plain . " 
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER IV . 
 
 
 With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family , and otherwise 
 diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton , sometimes dirty and 
 sometimes cold , did January and February pass away . <end>   4.280311714544191
<start> <start> March was to take 
 Elizabeth to Hunsford . <end>   10.185852005385884
<start> <start> Absence had increased her desire of seeing 
 Charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of Mr . Collins . <end>   4.8598602582743915
<start> <start> There was 
 novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such 
 uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change 
 was not unwelcome for its own sake . <end>   5.765944028526596
<start> <start> The journey would moreover give her 
 a peep at Jane ; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have 
 been very sorry for any delay . <end>   5.353565206060121
<start> <start> Every thing , however , went on smoothly , 
 and was finally settled according to Charlotte 's first sketch . <end>   4.340050622830969
<start> <start> She was 
 to accompany Sir William and his second daughter . <end>   6.699314227477253
<start> <start> The improvement of 
 spending a night in London was added in time , and the plan became 
 perfect as plan could be . <end>   4.547310904343965
<start> <start> The farewell between herself and Mr . Wickham was perfectly friendly ; on 
 his side even more . <end>   4.660445685173547
<start> <start> His present pursuit could not make him forget that 
 Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the 
 first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired ; and in his manner 
 of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what 
 she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their 
 opinion of her - - their opinion of every body - - would always coincide , 
 there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her 
 to him with a most sincere regard ; and she parted from him convinced , 
 that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the 
 amiable and pleasing . <end>   5.2806743533648985
<start> <start> Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good 
 humoured girl , but as empty - headed as himself , had nothing to say that 
 could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight 
 as the rattle of the chaise . <end>   5.467529330767962
<start> <start> Elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had 
 known Sir William 's too long . <end>   5.364065640209404
<start> <start> He could tell her nothing new of the 
 wonders of his presentation and knighthood ; and his civilities were worn 
 out like his information . <end>   3.920812521550404
<start> <start> As they drove to Mr . Gardiner 's 
 door , Jane was at a drawing - room window watching their arrival ; when 
 they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , 
 looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and 
 lovely as ever . <end>   5.283507247724329
<start> <start> On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , 
 whose eagerness for their cousin 's appearance would not allow them to 
 wait in the drawing - room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her 
 for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . <end>   4.238033369255787
<start> <start> All was joy and 
 kindness . <end>   5.964308814458792
<start> <start> Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt . <end>   5.652588329486908
<start> <start> It was reasonable , however , to 
 hope , that they would not continue long . <end>   6.485009993959295
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham 's desertion , and 
 complimented her on bearing it so well . <end>   3.769337413133563
<start> <start> " But , my dear Elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is Miss King ? <end>   4.468025981152107
<start> <start> I 
 should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . " 
 
 " Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , 
 between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? <end>   4.32371857541077
<start> <start> Where does discretion end , 
 and avarice begin ? <end>   4.4700430924038335
<start> <start> Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , 
 because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a 
 girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is 
 mercenary . " 
 
 " If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know 
 what to think . " 
 
 " She is a very good kind of girl , I believe . <end>   5.44561331271573
<start> <start> It only shews her being 
 deficient in something herself - - sense or feeling . " 
 
 " Well , " cried Elizabeth , " have it as you choose . <end>   4.180372934579856
<start> <start> _He_ shall be 
 mercenary , and _she_ shall be foolish . " 
 
 " No , Lizzy , that is what I do _not_ choose . <end>   6.517752134038748
<start> <start> I should be sorry , you know , 
 to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   4.400336051850832
<start> <start> if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in 
 Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not 
 much better . <end>   7.035968434007441
<start> <start> I am sick of them all . <end>   7.131321748363936
<start> <start> I am going to - morrow 
 where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has 
 neither manner nor sense to recommend him . <end>   4.220802192033972
<start> <start> Stupid men are the only ones 
 worth knowing , after all . " 
 
 " Take care , Lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment . " 
 
 Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the 
 unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in 
 a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer . <end>   4.047409357546408
<start> <start> Gardiner , " but perhaps to the Lakes . " 
 
 No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her 
 acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful . <end>   5.7801316876852535
<start> <start> " My dear , dear 
 aunt , " she rapturously cried , " what delight ! <end>   4.918348501551787
<start> <start> You give me 
 fresh life and vigour . <end>   4.105057641355622
<start> <start> Adieu to disappointment and spleen . <end>   3.501041630866093
<start> <start> What are men 
 to rocks and mountains ? <end>   4.020770859588936
<start> <start> what hours of transport we shall spend ! <end>   4.4712311803405544
<start> <start> Lakes , mountains , 
 and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when 
 we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling 
 about its relative situation . <end>   3.0248725874646274
<start> <start> Let _our_ first effusions be less 
 insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . " 
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER V . 
 
 
 Every object in the next day 's journey was new and interesting to 
 Elizabeth ; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment ; for she had 
 seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , 
 and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . <end>   4.785251379592733
<start> <start> When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford , every eye was in 
 search of the Parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view . <end>   4.7529973332822335
<start> <start> The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side . <end>   3.1146669788305372
<start> <start> At length the Parsonage was discernible . <end>   3.744872009531086
<start> <start> In a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the 
 sight of each other . <end>   6.0620746578577345
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest 
 pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when 
 she found herself so affectionately received . <end>   4.945624881591186
<start> <start> She saw instantly that her 
 cousin 's manners were not altered by his marriage ; his formal civility 
 was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate 
 to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family . <end>   4.427178581314206
<start> <start> They were then , 
 with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , 
 taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he 
 welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble 
 abode , and punctually repeated all his wife 's offers of refreshment . <end>   5.29779391170556
<start> <start> Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help 
 fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect 
 and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if 
 wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . <end>   4.804836211528007
<start> <start> But though 
 every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him 
 by any sigh of repentance ; and rather looked with wonder at her friend 
 that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion . <end>   4.977118041636142
<start> <start> When Mr . 
 Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , 
 which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on 
 Charlotte . <end>   4.808084359808961
<start> <start> Once or twice she could discern a faint blush ; but in general 
 Charlotte wisely did not hear . <end>   5.695892040164187
<start> <start> After sitting long enough to admire every 
 article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to 
 give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London , 
 Mr . Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large 
 and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself . <end>   5.883464605639123
<start> <start> Here , leading the way through every walk and cross 
 walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he 
 asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left 
 beauty entirely behind . <end>   2.7962415711010884
<start> <start> He could number the fields in every direction , 
 and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump . <end>   4.1748147357912035
<start> <start> But 
 of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom 
 could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings , 
 afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly 
 opposite the front of his house . <end>   4.764652268002931
<start> <start> It was a handsome modern building , well 
 situated on rising ground . <end>   3.4018492815613883
<start> <start> It was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and every 
 thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of 
 which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit . <end>   4.229782765639622
<start> <start> She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country . <end>   4.918833290259937
<start> <start> I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will 
 include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she 
 honours us during your stay here . <end>   4.165166030686621
<start> <start> Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is 
 charming . <end>   9.398878456250296
<start> <start> We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to 
 walk home . <end>   5.380928218013112
<start> <start> Her ladyship 's carriage is regularly ordered for us . <end>   3.1539402823408533
<start> <start> I 
 _should_ say , one of her ladyship 's carriages , for she has several . " 
 
 " Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added 
 Charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour . " 
 
 " Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . <end>   5.283556871861045
<start> <start> She is the sort of 
 woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference . " 
 
 The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news , and 
 telling again what had been already written ; and when it closed , 
 Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon 
 Charlotte 's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , 
 and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it 
 was all done very well . <end>   4.506070781847195
<start> <start> She had also to anticipate how her visit would 
 pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious 
 interruptions of Mr . Collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with 
 Rosings . <end>   3.530061146096359
<start> <start> About the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready 
 for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in 
 confusion ; and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up 
 stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . <end>   5.7298846868034445
<start> <start> She opened the 
 door , and met Maria in the landing place , who , breathless with 
 agitation , cried out , 
 
 " Oh , my dear Eliza ! <end>   5.6318047960983835
<start> <start> pray make haste and come into the dining - room , for 
 there is such a sight to be seen ! <end>   6.289475485664949
<start> <start> I will not tell you what it is . <end>   6.370254882426977
<start> <start> Make 
 haste , and come down this moment . " 
 
 Elizabeth asked questions in vain ; Maria would tell her nothing more , 
 and down they ran into the dining - room , which fronted the lane , in quest 
 of this wonder ; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the 
 garden gate . <end>   4.367978190845853
<start> <start> " And is this all ? " cried Elizabeth . <end>   4.435387963060304
<start> <start> " I expected at least that the pigs 
 were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her 
 daughter ! " 
 
 " La ! <end>   6.212694422076387
<start> <start> The old lady is Mrs . <end>   3.707350143274647
<start> <start> Jenkinson , who lives with them . <end>   6.227286221283289
<start> <start> The 
 other is Miss De Bourgh . <end>   4.95899757126505
<start> <start> Only look at her . <end>   6.228943978398244
<start> <start> Why does she not come in ? " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   3.406545605655358
<start> <start> It is the greatest of favours 
 when Miss De Bourgh comes in . " 
 
 " I like her appearance , " said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas . <end>   4.202308303817268
<start> <start> " She 
 looks sickly and cross . - - Yes , she will do for him very well . <end>   6.655922531328404
<start> <start> She will 
 make him a very proper wife . " 
 
 Mr . Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in 
 conversation with the ladies ; and Sir William , to Elizabeth 's high 
 diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the 
 greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh 
 looked that way . <end>   5.653941337427916
<start> <start> At length there was nothing more to be said ; the ladies drove on , and 
 the others returned into the house . <end>   6.773114754390412
<start> <start> Mr . Collins no sooner saw the two 
 girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which 
 Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked 
 to dine at Rosings the next day . <end>   4.381569775747735
<start> <start> CHAPTER VI . 
 
 
 Mr . Collins 's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete . <end>   4.306723034534677
<start> <start> The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering 
 visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his 
 wife , was exactly what he had wished for ; and that an opportunity of 
 doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of Lady 
 Catherine 's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough . <end>   4.757158644471396
<start> <start> " I confess , " said he , " that I should not have been at all surprised by 
 her Ladyship 's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at 
 Rosings . <end>   4.405516918766103
<start> <start> I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it 
 would happen . <end>   7.089677738304412
<start> <start> But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? <end>   6.44004360854958
<start> <start> Who 
 could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there 
 ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after 
 your arrival ! " 
 
 " I am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied Sir William , 
 " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which 
 my situation in life has allowed me to acquire . <end>   4.00108224272766
<start> <start> About the Court , such 
 instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . " 
 
 Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but 
 their visit to Rosings . <end>   5.196789881606321
<start> <start> Mr . Collins was carefully instructing them in 
 what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many 
 servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them . <end>   5.079392256491544
<start> <start> When the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to Elizabeth , 
 
 " Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel . <end>   3.9250739910359633
<start> <start> Lady 
 Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which 
 becomes herself and daughter . <end>   2.9719787409283334
<start> <start> I would advise you merely to put on 
 whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion 
 for any thing more . <end>   5.465964594887253
<start> <start> Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for 
 being simply dressed . <end>   7.579538001463216
<start> <start> She likes to have the distinction of rank 
 preserved . " 
 
 While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different 
 doors , to recommend their being quick , as Lady Catherine very much 
 objected to be kept waiting for her dinner . - - Such formidable accounts of 
 her Ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened Maria Lucas , 
 who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her 
 introduction at Rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had 
 done to his presentation at St . James 's . <end>   4.8414781696126035
<start> <start> As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile 
 across the park . - - Every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and 
 Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such 
 raptures as Mr . Collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but 
 slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the 
 house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally 
 cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh . <end>   4.069171191019919
<start> <start> When they ascended the steps to the hall , Maria 's alarm was every 
 moment increasing , and even Sir William did not look perfectly 
 calm . - - Elizabeth 's courage did not fail her . <end>   4.382797783847023
<start> <start> She had heard nothing of 
 Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or 
 miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she 
 thought she could witness without trepidation . <end>   4.199988686626332
<start> <start> From the entrance hall , of which Mr . Collins pointed out , with a 
 rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed 
 the servants through an anti - chamber , to the room where Lady Catherine , 
 her daughter , and Mrs . <end>   5.741665162671661
<start> <start> Jenkinson were sitting . - - Her Ladyship , with great 
 condescension , arose to receive them ; and as Mrs . <end>   4.471711220278972
<start> <start> Collins had settled it 
 with her husband that the office of introduction should be her 's , it was 
 performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks 
 which he would have thought necessary . <end>   6.851880478247524
<start> <start> In spite of having been at St . James 's , Sir William was so completely 
 awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage 
 enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; 
 and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge 
 of her chair , not knowing which way to look . <end>   4.64211456528125
<start> <start> Elizabeth found herself 
 quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her 
 composedly . - - Lady Catherine was a tall , large woman , with 
 strongly - marked features , which might once have been handsome . <end>   4.974806918251395
<start> <start> She was not rendered 
 formidable by silence ; but whatever she said , was spoken in so 
 authoritative a tone , as marked her self - importance , and brought Mr . 
 Wickham immediately to Elizabeth 's mind ; and from the observation of the 
 day altogether , she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had 
 represented . <end>   6.0696638644710035
<start> <start> When , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment 
 she soon found some resemblance of Mr . Darcy , she turned her eyes on the 
 daughter , she could almost have joined in Maria 's astonishment , at her 
 being so thin , and so small . <end>   5.6106691166663065
<start> <start> There was neither in figure nor face , any 
 likeness between the ladies . <end>   3.8838672991711753
<start> <start> Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly ; her 
 features , though not plain , were insignificant ; and she spoke very 
 little , except in a low voice , to Mrs . <end>   4.6591497644529305
<start> <start> Jenkinson , in whose appearance 
 there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening 
 to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before 
 her eyes . <end>   5.53811840830439
<start> <start> After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , 
 to admire the view , Mr . Collins attending them to point out its 
 beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much 
 better worth looking at in the summer . <end>   5.261811635029519
<start> <start> The dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , 
 and all the articles of plate which Mr . Collins had promised ; and , as he 
 had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by 
 her ladyship 's desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish 
 nothing greater . - - He carved , and ate , and praised with delighted 
 alacrity ; and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by Sir 
 William , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law 
 said , in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear . <end>   4.709003343869902
<start> <start> But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and 
 gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved 
 a novelty to them . <end>   3.7280131595069235
<start> <start> Elizabeth 
 was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated 
 between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh - - the former of whom was engaged in 
 listening to Lady Catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all 
 dinner time . <end>   5.95935403693061
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little 
 Miss De Bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she 
 were indisposed . <end>   4.682900016031174
<start> <start> Maria thought speaking out of the question , and the 
 gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . <end>   4.960449179629238
<start> <start> When the ladies returned to the drawing - room , there was little to be 
 done but to hear Lady Catherine talk , which she did without any 
 intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every 
 subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have 
 her judgment controverted . <end>   5.070391199106094
<start> <start> She enquired into Charlotte 's domestic 
 concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , 
 as to the management of them all ; told her how every thing ought to be 
 regulated in so small a family as her 's , and instructed her as to the 
 care of her cows and her poultry . <end>   4.967652652934121
<start> <start> Elizabeth found that nothing was 
 beneath this great Lady 's attention , which could furnish her with an 
 occasion of dictating to others . <end>   3.7579388987031406
<start> <start> Collins , she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and 
 Elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew 
 the least , and who she observed to Mrs . <end>   6.389921375039763
<start> <start> Collins , was a very genteel , 
 pretty kind of girl . <end>   6.878230406847467
<start> <start> She asked her at different times , how many sisters 
 she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of 
 them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they 
 had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her 
 mother 's maiden name ? - - Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her 
 questions , but answered them very composedly . - - Lady Catherine then 
 observed , 
 
 " Your father 's estate is entailed on Mr . Collins , I think . <end>   5.796083599582207
<start> <start> then - - some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . <end>   8.476278861165046
<start> <start> But I suppose you had no opportunity . <end>   6.502098957427135
<start> <start> Your mother 
 should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . " 
 
 " My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London . " 
 
 " Has your governess left you ? " 
 
 " We never had any governess . " 
 
 " No governess ! <end>   4.2334280359446765
<start> <start> How was that possible ? <end>   5.928447299180271
<start> <start> Five daughters brought up at home 
 without a governess ! - - I never heard of such a thing . <end>   5.246642816297239
<start> <start> Your mother must 
 have been quite a slave to your education . " 
 
 Elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not 
 been the case . <end>   5.759222446584347
<start> <start> " Then , who taught you ? <end>   7.468217684773299
<start> <start> who attended to you ? <end>   10.755696536419102
<start> <start> We were always encouraged to 
 read , and had all the masters that were necessary . <end>   5.911796548623303
<start> <start> Those who chose to be 
 idle , certainly might . " 
 
 " Aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had 
 known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage 
 one . <end>   4.819869834050598
<start> <start> I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady 
 and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . <end>   4.510384791363953
<start> <start> It is 
 wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that 
 way . <end>   4.762739556449174
<start> <start> I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . <end>   4.750708665729339
<start> <start> Four nieces 
 of Mrs . <end>   7.427709786268554
<start> <start> Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and 
 it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who 
 was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite 
 delighted with her . <end>   5.381275313790483
<start> <start> Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe 's 
 calling yesterday to thank me ? <end>   4.062120366282283
<start> <start> She finds Miss Pope a treasure . <end>   3.301374298673368
<start> <start> 'Lady 
 Catherine ,' said she , 'you have given me a treasure .' Are any of your 
 younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? " 
 
 " Yes , Ma 'am , all . " 
 
 " All ! - - What , all five out at once ? <end>   3.8273080014267316
<start> <start> Very odd ! - - And you only the 
 second . - - The younger ones out before the elder are married ! - - Your 
 younger sisters must be very young ? " 
 
 " Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . <end>   4.459937500885243
<start> <start> Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much 
 in company . <end>   5.920851432060045
<start> <start> But really , Ma 'am , I think it would be very hard upon 
 younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and 
 amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to 
 marry early . - - The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of 
 youth , as the first . <end>   4.724579157567137
<start> <start> And to be kept back on _such_ a motive ! - - I think it 
 would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of 
 mind . " 
 
 " Upon my word , " said her Ladyship , " you give your opinion very 
 decidedly for so young a person . - - Pray , what is your age ? " 
 
 " With three younger sisters grown up , " replied Elizabeth smiling , " your 
 Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . " 
 
 Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer ; 
 and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever 
 dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence . <end>   4.009879070035719
<start> <start> " You cannot be more than twenty , I am sure , - - therefore you need not 
 conceal your age . " 
 
 " I am not one and twenty . " 
 
 When the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables 
 were placed . <end>   4.7623991729304835
<start> <start> Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr . and Mrs . <end>   5.7377622315587855

 down to quadrille ; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino , the

<start> <start> Jenkinson to make up her 
 party . <end>   9.753224686168233
<start> <start> Their table was superlatively stupid . <end>   3.304329804006666
<start> <start> Scarcely a syllable was 
 uttered that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs . <end>   5.157973439252933
<start> <start> Jenkinson 
 expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh 's being too hot or too cold , or 
 having too much or too little light . <end>   3.2794728979388883
<start> <start> A great deal more passed at the 
 other table . <end>   6.118829914427057
<start> <start> Lady Catherine was generally speaking - - stating the mistakes 
 of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself . <end>   4.156141205471357
<start> <start> Mr . Collins 
 was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said , thanking her 
 for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many . <end>   4.817647820326523
<start> <start> Sir William did not say much . <end>   7.074971367270691
<start> <start> He was storing his memory with anecdotes 
 and noble names . <end>   3.039847918584224
<start> <start> When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , 
 the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to Mrs . <end>   4.910932458289575
<start> <start> Collins , 
 gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered . <end>   8.139152917026944
<start> <start> As 
 soon as they had driven from the door , Elizabeth was called on by her 
 cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings , which , 
 for Charlotte 's sake , she made more favourable than it really was . <end>   6.7100572448551175
<start> <start> But 
 her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means 
 satisfy Mr . Collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship 's 
 praise into his own hands . <end>   4.565209708634372
<start> <start> CHAPTER VII . 
 
 
 Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford ; but his visit was long enough 
 to convince him of his daughter 's being most comfortably settled , and of 
 her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met 
 with . <end>   5.7886619861659945
<start> <start> While Sir William was with them , Mr . Collins devoted his mornings 
 to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country ; but when he 
 went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and 
 Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin 
 by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and 
 dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading 
 and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which 
 fronted the road . <end>   5.938815067024983
<start> <start> The room in which the ladies sat was backwards . <end>   5.54210538211287
<start> <start> Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer 
 the dining - parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a 
 pleasanter aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent 
 reason for what she did , for Mr . Collins would undoubtedly have been 
 much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and 
 she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement . <end>   5.238404720927439
<start> <start> From the drawing - room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and 
 were indebted to Mr . Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went 
 along , and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton , 
 which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened 
 almost every day . <end>   5.024693609642961
<start> <start> She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage , and had 
 a few minutes 'conversation with Charlotte , but was scarcely ever 
 prevailed on to get out . <end>   5.330060688454879
<start> <start> Very few days passed in which Mr . Collins did not walk to Rosings , and 
 not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; 
 and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings 
 to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many 
 hours . <end>   5.278736679795699
<start> <start> She examined into their employments , looked at their work , 
 and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement 
 of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she 
 accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding 
 out that Mrs . <end>   4.083681271904287
<start> <start> Collins 's joints of meat were too large for her family . <end>   3.403647875952968
<start> <start> The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week ; 
 and , allowing for the loss of Sir William , and there being only one card 
 table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of 
 the first . <end>   4.218161097209037
<start> <start> This 
 however was no evil to Elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time 
 comfortably enough ; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with 
 Charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she 
 had often great enjoyment out of doors . <end>   5.677316734436455
<start> <start> Her favourite walk , and where 
 she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine , was 
 along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was 
 a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and 
 where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine 's curiosity . <end>   4.888642024895848
<start> <start> In this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away . <end>   5.114487623624296
<start> <start> Easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an 
 addition to the family at Rosings , which in so small a circle must be 
 important . <end>   6.0280530824661955
<start> <start> Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that Mr . Darcy 
 was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were 
 not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would 
 furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties , and 
 she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley 's designs on him 
 were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined 
 by Lady Catherine ; who talked of his coming with the greatest 
 satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and 
 seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by 
 Miss Lucas and herself . <end>   5.688509189177321
<start> <start> His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage , for Mr . Collins was walking 
 the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane , 
 in order to have the earliest assurance of it ; and after making his bow 
 as the carriage turned into the Park , hurried home with the great 
 intelligence . <end>   4.368064258267876
<start> <start> On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his 
 respects . <end>   3.437770307343977
<start> <start> There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them , for 
 Mr . Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam , the younger son of 
 his uncle , Lord - - - - and to the great surprise of all the party , when 
 Mr . Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him . <end>   5.893005690979106
<start> <start> Charlotte had seen 
 them from her husband 's room , crossing the road , and immediately running 
 into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , 
 
 " I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . <end>   5.246012901686107
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy would 
 never have come so soon to wait upon me . " 
 
 Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , 
 before their approach was announced by the door - bell , and shortly 
 afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . <end>   4.473093413316978
<start> <start> Colonel Fitzwilliam , 
 who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and 
 address most truly the gentleman . <end>   6.305020189725144
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy looked just as he had been 
 used to look in Hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual 
 reserve , to Mrs . <end>   4.569801997957656
<start> <start> Collins ; and whatever might be his feelings towards her 
 friend , met her with every appearance of composure . <end>   7.367671581489582
<start> <start> Elizabeth merely 
 curtseyed to him , without saying a word . <end>   4.5194607166008245
<start> <start> Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the 
 readiness and ease of a well - bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but 
 his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and 
 garden to Mrs . <end>   5.009296800381251
<start> <start> Collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body . <end>   3.9868092217339575
<start> <start> At length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of 
 Elizabeth after the health of her family . <end>   5.825143213211933
<start> <start> She answered him in the usual 
 way , and after a moment 's pause , added , 
 
 " My eldest sister has been in town these three months . <end>   5.996901591539811
<start> <start> Have you never 
 happened to see her there ? " 
 
 She was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see 
 whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the 
 Bingleys and Jane ; and she thought he looked a little confused as he 
 answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet . <end>   5.427303712310604
<start> <start> The 
 subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went 
 away . <end>   4.390164502426255
<start> <start> CHAPTER VIII . 
 
 
 Colonel Fitzwilliam 's manners were very much admired at the parsonage , 
 and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of 
 their engagements at Rosings . <end>   6.250431906652737
<start> <start> It was some days , however , before they 
 received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the 
 house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till Easter - day , 
 almost a week after the gentlemen 's arrival , that they were honoured by 
 such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to 
 come there in the evening . <end>   5.178738935471277
<start> <start> For the last week they had seen very little 
 of either Lady Catherine or her daughter . <end>   6.4938493744581
<start> <start> Colonel Fitzwilliam had called 
 at the parsonage more than once during the time , but Mr . Darcy they had 
 only seen at church . <end>   5.320549133831116
<start> <start> Her ladyship received them 
 civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so 
 acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , 
 almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to Darcy , 
 much more than to any other person in the room . <end>   5.538806446031978
<start> <start> Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; any thing was a 
 welcome relief to him at Rosings ; and Mrs . <end>   6.390621162720668
<start> <start> Collins 's pretty friend had 
 moreover caught his fancy very much . <end>   3.7104057138380235
<start> <start> He now seated himself by her , and 
 talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , of travelling and staying 
 at home , of new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been half so 
 well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much 
 spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as 
 well as of Mr . Darcy . <end>   4.21355734857985
<start> <start> _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned 
 towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship after a 
 while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not 
 scruple to call out , 
 
 " What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? <end>   5.164789213576171
<start> <start> What is it you are talking 
 of ? <end>   6.905368918414137
<start> <start> What are you telling Miss Bennet ? <end>   6.511200902503345
<start> <start> " Of music ! <end>   5.617088836786645
<start> <start> Then pray speak aloud . <end>   4.314165692030278
<start> <start> It is of all subjects my delight . <end>   5.092964801063077
<start> <start> I 
 must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . <end>   7.229428686927393
<start> <start> There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment 
 of music than myself , or a better natural taste . <end>   4.341388427826194
<start> <start> And so would Anne , if her health 
 had allowed her to apply . <end>   5.003686031170695
<start> <start> How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? " 
 
 Mr . Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister 's proficiency . <end>   4.367575024099585
<start> <start> " I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said Lady 
 Catherine ; " and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , 
 if she does not practise a great deal . " 
 
 " I assure you , Madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advice . <end>   5.4204402051036045
<start> <start> She practises very constantly . " 
 
 " So much the better . <end>   3.034925061861982
<start> <start> It cannot be done too much ; and when I next write 
 to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . <end>   6.177951740115356
<start> <start> I have told Miss Bennet several times , that 
 she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though 
 Mrs . <end>   4.682411477648903
<start> <start> Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often 
 told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano - forte in 
 Mrs . <end>   8.261743902619326
<start> <start> Jenkinson 's room . <end>   6.286517095555494
<start> <start> She would be in nobody 's way , you know , in that 
 part of the house . " 
 
 Mr . Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt 's ill breeding , and made 
 no answer . <end>   6.551639725511877
<start> <start> He 
 drew a chair near her . <end>   3.1509265614929824
<start> <start> Lady Catherine listened to half a song , and then 
 talked , as before , to her other nephew ; till the latter walked away from 
 her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano - forte , 
 stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer 's 
 countenance . <end>   5.20353671612069
<start> <start> Elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first 
 convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , 
 
 " You mean to frighten me , Mr . Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear 
 me ? <end>   6.155187947477297
<start> <start> But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well . <end>   3.2581842300978843
<start> <start> There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at 
 the will of others . <end>   4.485308791676047
<start> <start> My courage always rises with every attempt to 
 intimidate me . " 
 
 " I shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could 
 not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I 
 have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you 
 find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact 
 are not your own . " 
 
 Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to 
 Colonel Fitzwilliam , " Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of 
 me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . <end>   5.252979650594431
<start> <start> Indeed , Mr . Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention 
 all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire - - and , give me 
 leave to say , very impolitic too - - for it is provoking me to retaliate , 
 and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . " 
 
 " I am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly . <end>   4.970959754897649
<start> <start> " I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . " 
 
 " You shall hear then - - but prepare yourself for something very dreadful . <end>   3.1039857673408675
<start> <start> The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , 
 was at a ball - - and at this ball , what do you think he did ? <end>   6.686889520643323
<start> <start> He danced 
 only four dances ! <end>   4.660567284411343
<start> <start> He danced only 
 four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , 
 more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . <end>   5.103102882870908
<start> <start> Mr . 
 Darcy , you cannot deny the fact . " 
 
 " I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly 
 beyond my own party . " 
 
 " True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room . <end>   4.642145964228989
<start> <start> Well , Colonel 
 Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? <end>   4.303707750840909
<start> <start> My fingers wait your orders . " 
 
 " Perhaps , " said Darcy , " I should have judged better , had I sought an 
 introduction , but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . " 
 
 " Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? " said Elizabeth , still 
 addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam . <end>   3.782855743501059
<start> <start> " Shall we ask him why a man of sense and 
 education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend 
 himself to strangers ? " 
 
 " I can answer your question , " said Fitzwilliam , " without applying to 
 him . <end>   4.658611093891605
<start> <start> It is because he will not give himself the trouble . " 
 
 " I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said Darcy , 
 " of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . <end>   4.27201487671433
<start> <start> I cannot 
 catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their 
 concerns , as I often see done . " 
 
 " My fingers , " said Elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the 
 masterly manner which I see so many women 's do . <end>   4.176217650737719
<start> <start> They have not the same 
 force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . <end>   5.617601896187647
<start> <start> But then I 
 have always supposed it to be my own fault - - because I would not take the 
 trouble of practising . <end>   7.146817612242205
<start> <start> It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as 
 capable as any other woman 's of superior execution . " 
 
 Darcy smiled and said , " You are perfectly right . <end>   4.6226774280455825
<start> <start> You have employed your 
 time much better . <end>   4.443370800195834
<start> <start> No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can 
 think any thing wanting . <end>   6.1284611145332795
<start> <start> We neither of us perform to strangers . " 
 
 Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called out to know 
 what they were talking of . <end>   5.082878631601055
<start> <start> Elizabeth immediately began playing again . <end>   3.569567360710323
<start> <start> Lady Catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said 
 to Darcy , 
 
 " Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and 
 could have the advantage of a London master . <end>   6.593237025632456
<start> <start> Anne would have 
 been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . " 
 
 Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his 
 cousin 's praise ; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she 
 discern any symptom of love ; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss 
 De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have 
 been just as likely to marry _her_ , had she been his relation . <end>   4.766230725547713
<start> <start> Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth 's performance , mixing 
 with them many instructions on execution and taste . <end>   3.3093520651999957
<start> <start> CHAPTER IX . 
 
 
 Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to Jane , 
 while Mrs . <end>   6.27006513247292
<start> <start> Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village , 
 when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a 
 visitor . <end>   5.488564663279742
<start> <start> As she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be 
 Lady Catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her 
 half - finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , 
 when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , Mr . Darcy , and Mr . 
 Darcy only , entered the room . <end>   4.984891579382196
<start> <start> He seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his 
 intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to 
 be within . <end>   5.3243256257077505
<start> <start> They then sat down , and when her enquiries after Rosings were made , 
 seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . <end>   4.2184789093024895
<start> <start> It was absolutely 
 necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence 
 recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire , and feeling 
 curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty 
 departure , she observed , 
 
 " How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr . Darcy ! <end>   4.433829060173836
<start> <start> It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr . Bingley to see you 
 all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day 
 before . <end>   5.792473218898864
<start> <start> He has many friends , and he is 
 at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually 
 increasing . " 
 
 " If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the 
 neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we 
 might possibly get a settled family there . <end>   4.353200959159054
<start> <start> But perhaps Mr . Bingley did 
 not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as 
 for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same 
 principle . " 
 
 " I should not be surprised , " said Darcy , " if he were to give it up , as 
 soon as any eligible purchase offers . " 
 
 Elizabeth made no answer . <end>   5.907373877850555
<start> <start> He took the hint , and soon began with , " This seems a very comfortable 
 house . <end>   6.84512538617975
<start> <start> Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr . 
 Collins first came to Hunsford . " 
 
 " I believe she did - - and I am sure she could not have bestowed her 
 kindness on a more grateful object . " 
 
 " Mr . Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . " 
 
 " Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of 
 the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made 
 him happy if they had . <end>   4.918004328634363
<start> <start> My friend has an excellent understanding - - though 
 I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr . Collins as the wisest 
 thing she ever did . <end>   5.141048642734487
<start> <start> She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a 
 prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . " 
 
 " It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a 
 distance of her own family and friends . " 
 
 " An easy distance do you call it ? <end>   5.026905191881048
<start> <start> It is nearly fifty miles . " 
 
 " And what is fifty miles of good road ? <end>   3.4106947621656953
<start> <start> Little more than half a day 's 
 journey . <end>   8.39031388523676
<start> <start> Yes , I call it a _very_ easy distance . " 
 
 " I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ 
 of the match , " cried Elizabeth . <end>   4.629324647073016
<start> <start> " I should never have said Mrs . <end>   4.571988598997973
<start> <start> Collins 
 was settled _near_ her family . " 
 
 " It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire . <end>   4.496116977369094
<start> <start> Any thing beyond 
 the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . " 
 
 As he spoke there was a sort of smile , which Elizabeth fancied she 
 understood ; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and 
 Netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , 
 
 " I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her 
 family . <end>   5.913605998492194
<start> <start> The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many 
 varying circumstances . <end>   5.942130520555653
<start> <start> Where there is fortune to make the expence of 
 travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil . <end>   3.7472903381027236
<start> <start> But that is not the 
 case _here_ . <end>   7.487389709073186
<start> <start> Mr . and Mrs . <end>   3.5178705043188505
<start> <start> Collins have a comfortable income , but not 
 such a one as will allow of frequent journeys - - and I am persuaded my 
 friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ 
 the present distance . " 
 
 Mr . Darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " _You_ cannot 
 have a right to such very strong local attachment . <end>   4.486195662071116
<start> <start> The gentleman experienced some change of 
 feeling ; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , 
 glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , 
 
 " Are you pleased with Kent ? " 
 
 A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side 
 calm and concise - - and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte 
 and her sister , just returned from their walk . <end>   4.421677228199534
<start> <start> The tête - à - tête surprised 
 them . <end>   2.860132040051089
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding 
 on Miss Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying 
 much to any body , went away . <end>   4.474927478085679
<start> <start> " What can be the meaning of this ! " said Charlotte , as soon as he was 
 gone . <end>   6.640220176628418
<start> <start> " My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have 
 called on us in this familiar way . " 
 
 But when Elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , 
 even to Charlotte 's wishes , to be the case ; and after various 
 conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from 
 the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable 
 from the time of year . <end>   5.362799010853264
<start> <start> All field sports were over . <end>   3.9940588349463098
<start> <start> Within doors there 
 was Lady Catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be 
 always within doors ; and in the nearness of the Parsonage , or the 
 pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the 
 two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither 
 almost every day . <end>   5.865253521384149
<start> <start> They called at various times of the morning , sometimes 
 separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their 
 aunt . <end>   4.960371681364465
<start> <start> It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he 
 had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended 
 him still more ; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in 
 being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her 
 former favourite George Wickham ; and though , in comparing them , she saw 
 there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam 's manners , 
 she believed he might have the best informed mind . <end>   5.753047104226968
<start> <start> It could not be for society , as he frequently sat there 
 ten minutes together without opening his lips ; and when he did speak , it 
 seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice - - a sacrifice to 
 propriety , not a pleasure to himself . <end>   4.930026660402771
<start> <start> He seldom appeared really 
 animated . <end>   3.8235372995292245
<start> <start> Collins knew not what to make of him . <end>   5.828655031966367
<start> <start> Colonel 
 Fitzwilliam 's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was 
 generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told 
 her ; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of 
 love , and the object of that love , her friend Eliza , she sat herself 
 seriously to work to find it out . - - She watched him whenever they were at 
 Rosings , and whenever he came to Hunsford ; but without much success . <end>   5.526473663172262
<start> <start> It was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often 
 doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it 
 seemed nothing but absence of mind . <end>   3.928711627644023
<start> <start> She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his 
 being partial to her , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and Mrs . <end>   5.50114616893817
<start> <start> In her kind schemes for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying 
 Colonel Fitzwilliam . <end>   4.198188800177285
<start> <start> He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man ; he 
 certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , 
 to counterbalance these advantages , Mr . Darcy had considerable patronage 
 in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . <end>   4.983047210253482
<start> <start> It seemed like wilful 
 ill - nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not 
 merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he 
 actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . <end>   3.9274517328619876
<start> <start> He never 
 said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of 
 listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre 
 that he was asking some odd unconnected questions - - about her pleasure in 
 being at Hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of Mr . 
 and Mrs . <end>   4.903925648401442
<start> <start> Collins 's happiness ; and that in speaking of Rosings and her 
 not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever 
 she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too . <end>   5.51393419871445
<start> <start> Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? <end>   5.745661075414762
<start> <start> She supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what 
 might arise in that quarter . <end>   5.38508982977988
<start> <start> She was engaged one day as she walked , in re - perusing Jane 's last 
 letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not 
 written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by Mr . Darcy , 
 she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her . <end>   4.042180023108402
<start> <start> Putting 
 away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , 
 
 " I did not know before that you ever walked this way . " 
 
 " I have been making the tour of the Park , " he replied , " as I generally 
 do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage . <end>   4.5478419028791945
<start> <start> Are 
 you going much farther ? " 
 
 " No , I should have turned in a moment . " 
 
 And accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the Parsonage 
 together . <end>   4.538825706603677
<start> <start> " Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? " said she . <end>   3.4624719668102237
<start> <start> " Yes - - if Darcy does not put it off again . <end>   5.4716086667452934
<start> <start> But I am at his disposal . <end>   6.296349189833948
<start> <start> He 
 arranges the business just as he pleases . " 
 
 " And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least 
 great pleasure in the power of choice . <end>   4.905827685156917
<start> <start> I do not know any body who seems 
 more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr . Darcy . " 
 
 " He likes to have his own way very well , " replied Colonel Fitzwilliam . <end>   4.474668787769744
<start> <start> " But so we all do . <end>   4.700835456910507
<start> <start> It is only that he has better means of having it than 
 many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . <end>   5.100416746218283
<start> <start> A younger son , you know , must be inured to self - denial and 
 dependence . " 
 
 " In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of 
 either . <end>   4.751478582550344
<start> <start> Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self - denial and 
 dependence ? <end>   3.6498065147665724
<start> <start> When have you been prevented by want of money from going 
 wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? " 
 
 " These are home questions - - and perhaps I cannot say that I have 
 experienced many hardships of that nature . <end>   3.7219390514565722
<start> <start> But in matters of greater 
 weight , I may suffer from the want of money . <end>   4.164906980737203
<start> <start> Unless the elder brother is 
 very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . " 
 
 He answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . <end>   5.31774334480444
<start> <start> To interrupt 
 a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , 
 she soon afterwards said , 
 
 " I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of 
 having somebody at his disposal . <end>   3.7322859636735033
<start> <start> But , perhaps his sister does as well 
 for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he 
 likes with her . " 
 
 " No , " said Colonel Fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must 
 divide with me . <end>   5.664873961410599
<start> <start> I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . " 
 
 " Are you , indeed ? <end>   6.820313915227814
<start> <start> And pray what sort of guardians do you make ? <end>   4.507913907248156
<start> <start> Does your 
 charge give you much trouble ? <end>   5.967904695352045
<start> <start> Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a 
 little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she 
 may like to have her own way . " 
 
 As she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner 
 in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to 
 give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other 
 got pretty near the truth . <end>   4.874602185007975
<start> <start> She directly replied , 
 
 " You need not be frightened . <end>   5.880703920674557
<start> <start> She is a 
 very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs . <end>   4.874402458432743
<start> <start> Hurst and 
 Miss Bingley . <end>   10.817629324236384
<start> <start> I think I have heard you say that you know them . " 
 
 " I know them a little . <end>   7.614524620525397
<start> <start> Their brother is a pleasant gentleman - like 
 man - - he is a great friend of Darcy 's . " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   4.8348803852966915
<start> <start> yes , " said Elizabeth drily - - " Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr . 
 Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . " 
 
 " Care of him ! - - Yes , I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in 
 those points where he most wants care . <end>   4.632385595441519
<start> <start> From something that he told me in 
 our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to 
 him . <end>   6.435237295297583
<start> <start> But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that 
 Bingley was the person meant . <end>   6.01409330250852
<start> <start> It was all conjecture . " 
 
 " What is it you mean ? " 
 
 " It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be 
 generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady 's family , 
 it would be an unpleasant thing . " 
 
 " You may depend upon my not mentioning it . " 
 
 " And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be 
 Bingley . <end>   4.330870295436511
<start> <start> What he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself 
 on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most 
 imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other 
 particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him 
 the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from 
 knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . " 
 
 " Did Mr . Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? " 
 
 " I understood that there were some very strong objections against the 
 lady . " 
 
 " And what arts did he use to separate them ? " 
 
 " He did not talk to me of his own arts , " said Fitzwilliam smiling . <end>   4.431901440871681
<start> <start> " He 
 only told me , what I have now told you . " 
 
 Elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with 
 indignation . <end>   5.621077094727348
<start> <start> " I am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she . <end>   5.914026968200203
<start> <start> " Your 
 cousin 's conduct does not suit my feelings . <end>   4.511201335804931
<start> <start> Why was he to be the judge ? " 
 
 " You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? " 
 
 " I do not see what right Mr . Darcy had to decide on the propriety of 
 his friend 's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to 
 determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . " " But , " 
 she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the 
 particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . <end>   5.089286560582146
<start> <start> It is not to be supposed 
 that there was much affection in the case . " 
 
 " That is not an unnatural surmise , " said Fitzwilliam , " but it is 
 lessening the honour of my cousin 's triumph very sadly . " 
 
 This was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of 
 Mr . Darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer ; and , 
 therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent 
 matters till they reached the parsonage . <end>   4.518072417390976
<start> <start> There , shut into her own room , 
 as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption 
 of all that she had heard . <end>   6.382646132789172
<start> <start> It was not to be supposed that any other 
 people could be meant than those with whom she was connected . <end>   4.849625969802337
<start> <start> That he had been concerned in the measures 
 taken to separate Mr . Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted ; but she 
 had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and 
 arrangement of them . <end>   5.808771567185236
<start> <start> " There were some very strong objections against the lady , " were Colonel 
 Fitzwilliam 's words , and these strong objections probably were , her 
 having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in 
 business in London . <end>   5.223304521327201
<start> <start> " To Jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of 
 objection . <end>   8.637362728773013
<start> <start> All loveliness and goodness as she is ! <end>   5.242511887970518
<start> <start> Her understanding 
 excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . <end>   5.680748393414747
<start> <start> The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a 
 headache ; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to 
 her unwillingness to see Mr . Darcy , it determined her not to attend her 
 cousins to Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . <end>   5.36504122114343
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Collins , 
 seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much 
 as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but Mr . Collins 
 could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine 's being rather 
 displeased by her staying at home . <end>   6.352640202853518
<start> <start> CHAPTER XI . 
 
 
 When they were gone , Elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as 
 much as possible against Mr . Darcy , chose for her employment the 
 examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her 
 being in Kent . <end>   6.205954225418561
<start> <start> But in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that 
 cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , 
 proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly 
 disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded . <end>   5.640086465892162
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy 's 
 shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a 
 keener sense of her sister 's sufferings . <end>   4.820318316113769
<start> <start> It was some consolation to 
 think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next , 
 and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be 
 with Jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her 
 spirits , by all that affection could do . <end>   6.177762095535629
<start> <start> She could not think of Darcy 's leaving Kent , without remembering that 
 his cousin was to go with him ; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear 
 that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not 
 mean to be unhappy about him . <end>   6.4339605676190095
<start> <start> While settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the 
 door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its 
 being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in 
 the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her . <end>   5.770594649110387
<start> <start> But 
 this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently 
 affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw Mr . Darcy walk into the 
 room . <end>   6.227359062841693
<start> <start> She answered him with cold civility . <end>   4.42934601120402
<start> <start> He sat down for a few moments , and 
 then getting up walked about the room . <end>   4.8362409039666705
<start> <start> After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an 
 agitated manner , and thus began , 
 
 " In vain have I struggled . <end>   5.12798016781234
<start> <start> It will not do . <end>   9.687396056308705
<start> <start> My feelings will not be 
 repressed . <end>   5.435710613515252
<start> <start> She stared , coloured , 
 doubted , and was silent . <end>   6.419673917873112
<start> <start> This he considered sufficient encouragement , 
 and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , 
 immediately followed . <end>   6.003833429144767
<start> <start> In spite of her deeply - rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to 
 the compliment of such a man 's affection , and though her intentions did 
 not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to 
 receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost 
 all compassion in anger . <end>   4.411982293681078
<start> <start> He concluded with 
 representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of 
 all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer ; and with 
 expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of 
 his hand . <end>   5.340158794094856
<start> <start> As he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of 
 a favourable answer . <end>   6.906167811983661
<start> <start> He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety , but his 
 countenance expressed real security . <end>   3.5726419078501537
<start> <start> Such a circumstance could only 
 exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her 
 cheeks , and she said , 
 
 " In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to 
 express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however 
 unequally they may be returned . <end>   4.639823367046388
<start> <start> But I 
 cannot - - I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly 
 bestowed it most unwillingly . <end>   5.52193770431352
<start> <start> I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any 
 one . <end>   5.090390637806439
<start> <start> The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the 
 acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming 
 it after this explanation . " 
 
 Mr . Darcy , who was leaning against the mantle - piece with his eyes fixed 
 on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than 
 surprise . <end>   4.29815490328193
<start> <start> His complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of 
 his mind was visible in every feature . <end>   4.665778396259091
<start> <start> He was struggling for the 
 appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed 
 himself to have attained it . <end>   5.283911667344464
<start> <start> The pause was to Elizabeth 's feelings 
 dreadful . <end>   7.872818554107162
<start> <start> At length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , 
 
 " And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! <end>   5.073837130691604
<start> <start> I 
 might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _endeavour_ at 
 civility , I am thus rejected . <end>   5.895439614292818
<start> <start> But it is of small importance . " 
 
 " I might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of 
 offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me 
 against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? <end>   4.867550994491122
<start> <start> Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I _was_ uncivil ? <end>   3.3373163050153405
<start> <start> But I have 
 other provocations . <end>   8.530711595920224
<start> <start> You know I have . <end>   10.36837696023487
<start> <start> Had not my own feelings decided 
 against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been 
 favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept 
 the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the 
 happiness of a most beloved sister ? " 
 
 As she pronounced these words , Mr . Darcy changed colour ; but the emotion 
 was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she 
 continued . <end>   4.556359763036577
<start> <start> " I have every reason in the world to think ill of you . <end>   5.824995393682577
<start> <start> No motive can 
 excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_ . <end>   2.2145155068028264
<start> <start> With assumed tranquillity he then replied , " I have no wish of denying 
 that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your 
 sister , or that I rejoice in my success . <end>   4.975906515864762
<start> <start> " But it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike 
 is founded . <end>   5.629951299308336
<start> <start> Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was 
 decided . <end>   7.909569474965119
<start> <start> On this subject , what can you have to 
 say ? <end>   10.661378507682649
<start> <start> In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? <end>   2.7077926272683204
<start> <start> " You have reduced 
 him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty . <end>   4.440147403068237
<start> <start> You have 
 withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for 
 him . <end>   7.899159597177865
<start> <start> You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence 
 which was no less his due than his desert . <end>   5.41398262306039
<start> <start> This is the estimation in which you hold me ! <end>   4.496956233350672
<start> <start> I 
 thank you for explaining it so fully . <end>   3.597719014467889
<start> <start> But perhaps , " added he , stopping in his 
 walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been 
 overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the 
 scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . <end>   4.63196911788797
<start> <start> These 
 bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater policy 
 concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being 
 impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by 
 reflection , by every thing . <end>   3.3357018566164194
<start> <start> But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . <end>   4.1824356605986015
<start> <start> Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . <end>   7.058219281605266
<start> <start> They were natural and just . <end>   3.736512290124998
<start> <start> Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? <end>   6.4513732596878866
<start> <start> To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life 
 is so decidedly beneath my own ? " 
 
 Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to 
 the utmost to speak with composure when she said , 
 
 " You are mistaken , Mr . Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your 
 declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the 
 concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a 
 more gentleman - like manner . " 
 
 She saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , 
 
 " You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way 
 that would have tempted me to accept it . " 
 
 Again his astonishment was obvious ; and he looked at her with an 
 expression of mingled incredulity and mortification . <end>   4.572812978529812
<start> <start> She went on . <end>   7.889781754102878
<start> <start> " From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my 
 acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest 
 belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the 
 feelings of others , were such as to form that ground - work of 
 disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a 
 dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the 
 last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . " 
 
 " You have said quite enough , madam . <end>   4.814396735489506
<start> <start> I perfectly comprehend your 
 feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . <end>   8.889648268969541
<start> <start> The tumult of her mind was now painfully great . <end>   6.02397206826692
<start> <start> She knew not how to 
 support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an 
 hour . <end>   3.969163114196468
<start> <start> Her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was 
 increased by every review of it . <end>   4.2439441187672875
<start> <start> That she should receive an offer of 
 marriage from Mr . Darcy ! <end>   6.075942866126957
<start> <start> that he should have been in love with her for 
 so many months ! <end>   9.35014215059778
<start> <start> so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all 
 the objections which had made him prevent his friend 's marrying her 
 sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , 
 was almost incredible ! <end>   6.310313484753126
<start> <start> it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously 
 so strong an affection . <end>   5.013292153711583
<start> <start> She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady 
 Catherine 's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter 
 Charlotte 's observation , and hurried her away to her room . <end>   4.032133103777775
<start> <start> CHAPTER XII . 
 
 
 Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations 
 which had at length closed her eyes . <end>   5.291047626116924
<start> <start> She could not yet recover from the 
 surprise of what had happened ; it was impossible to think of any thing 
 else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after 
 breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . <end>   4.665396636068652
<start> <start> She was proceeding 
 directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of Mr . Darcy 's 
 sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , 
 she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road . <end>   4.944279010771132
<start> <start> The park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed 
 one of the gates into the ground . <end>   4.337364506050594
<start> <start> After walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was 
 tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and 
 look into the park . <end>   5.948150699553552
<start> <start> The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent , had 
 made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the 
 verdure of the early trees . <end>   6.746476856873533
<start> <start> She was on the point of continuing her walk , 
 when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which 
 edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and fearful of its being Mr . 
 Darcy , she was directly retreating . <end>   4.6308079017346815
<start> <start> She had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in 
 a voice which proved it to be Mr . Darcy , she moved again towards the 
 gate . <end>   6.404899323048011
<start> <start> He had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , 
 which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " I 
 have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . <end>   5.07457362798824
<start> <start> Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? " - - And then , with a 
 slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of 
 sight . <end>   6.219569260430492
<start> <start> It was dated 
 from Rosings , at eight o 'clock in the morning , and was as follows : - - 
 
 " Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the 
 apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , 
 or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to 
 you . <end>   5.271636049490613
<start> <start> I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling 
 myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , 
 cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , 
 and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been 
 spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . <end>   5.20517932646223
<start> <start> You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your 
 attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I 
 demand it of your justice . <end>   4.968366914706481
<start> <start> " Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal 
 magnitude , you last night laid to my charge . <end>   4.543482647277532
<start> <start> The first mentioned 
 was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached 
 Mr . Bingley from your sister , - - and the other , that I had , in 
 defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , 
 ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of Mr . 
 Wickham . - - Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of 
 my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who 
 had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who 
 had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , 
 to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could 
 be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . - - But 
 from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally 
 bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in 
 future secured , when the following account of my actions and their 
 motives has been read . - - If , in the explanation of them which is 
 due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which 
 may be offensive to your 's , I can only say that I am sorry . - - The 
 necessity must be obeyed - - and farther apology would be absurd . - - I 
 had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with 
 others , that Bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other 
 young woman in the country . - - But it was not till the evening of the 
 dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a 
 serious attachment . - - I had often seen him in love before . - - At that 
 ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made 
 acquainted , by Sir William Lucas 's accidental information , that 
 Bingley 's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general 
 expectation of their marriage . <end>   5.712218477100175
<start> <start> He spoke of it as a certain event , 
 of which the time alone could be undecided . <end>   8.79705093565857
<start> <start> Your sister I also watched . - - Her look and 
 manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any 
 symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the 
 evening 's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with 
 pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of 
 sentiment . - - If _you_ have not been mistaken here , _I_ must have 
 been in an error . <end>   4.451008473519914
<start> <start> Your superior knowledge of your sister must make 
 the latter probable . - - If it be so , if I have been misled by such 
 error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been 
 unreasonable . <end>   5.923989290635619
<start> <start> But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity 
 of your sister 's countenance and air was such , as might have given 
 the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her 
 temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . - - That I was 
 desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , - - but I will 
 venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually 
 influenced by my hopes or fears . - - I did not believe her to be 
 indifferent because I wished it ; - - I believed it on impartial 
 conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason . - - My objections to 
 the marriage were not merely those , which I last night acknowledged 
 to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my 
 own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to 
 my friend as to me . - - But there were other causes of 
 repugnance ; - - causes which , though still existing , and existing to 
 an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to 
 forget , because they were not immediately before me . - - These causes 
 must be stated , though briefly . - - The situation of your mother 's 
 family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that 
 total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed 
 by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by 
 your father . - - Pardon me . - - It pains me to offend you . <end>   4.909917979157947
<start> <start> But amidst 
 your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your 
 displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you 
 consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to 
 avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally 
 bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to 
 the sense and disposition of both . - - I will only say farther , that 
 from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was 
 confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me 
 before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy 
 connection . - - He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , 
 as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon 
 returning . - - The part which I acted , is now to be explained . - - His 
 sisters 'uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our 
 coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible 
 that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly 
 resolved on joining him directly in London . - - We accordingly 
 went - - and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to 
 my friend , the certain evils of such a choice . - - I described , and 
 enforced them earnestly . - - But , however this remonstrance might have 
 staggered or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it 
 would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been 
 seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your 
 sister 's indifference . <end>   5.019555054373043
<start> <start> He had before believed her to return his 
 affection with sincere , if not with equal regard . - - But Bingley has 
 great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment 
 than on his own . - - To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived 
 himself , was no very difficult point . <end>   5.153903284701042
<start> <start> There is but one part of my conduct in the 
 whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is 
 that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to 
 conceal from him your sister 's being in town . <end>   4.828036403728015
<start> <start> I knew it myself , as 
 it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant 
 of it . - - That they might have met without ill consequence , is 
 perhaps probable ; - - but his regard did not appear to me enough 
 extinguished for him to see her without some danger . - - Perhaps this 
 concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . - - It is done , however , 
 and it was done for the best . - - On this subject I have nothing more 
 to say , no other apology to offer . <end>   6.224613049416789
<start> <start> If I have wounded your sister 's 
 feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which 
 governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have 
 not yet learnt to condemn them . - - With respect to that other , more 
 weighty accusation , of having injured Mr . Wickham , I can only 
 refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my 
 family . <end>   4.688379280984789
<start> <start> Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant ; but 
 of the truth of what I shall relate , I can summon more than one 
 witness of undoubted veracity . <end>   5.804910615037598
<start> <start> Mr . Wickham is the son of a very 
 respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the 
 Pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his 
 trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on 
 George Wickham , who was his god - son , his kindness was therefore 
 liberally bestowed . <end>   4.526450217846688
<start> <start> My father supported him at school , and 
 afterwards at Cambridge ; - - most important assistance , as his own 
 father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have 
 been unable to give him a gentleman 's education . <end>   4.7196905875253
<start> <start> My father was not 
 only fond of this young man 's society , whose manners were always 
 engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the 
 church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . <end>   6.019939660836197
<start> <start> As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think 
 of him in a very different manner . <end>   7.003382166649573
<start> <start> The vicious propensities - - the 
 want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge 
 of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man 
 of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of 
 seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr . Darcy could not have . <end>   6.063718909449786
<start> <start> Here again I shall give you pain - - to what degree you only can tell . <end>   4.689273732897262
<start> <start> But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr . Wickham has created , a 
 suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his 
 real character . <end>   4.578087289911186
<start> <start> It adds even another motive . <end>   3.6347902010330557
<start> <start> His own 
 father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these 
 events , Mr . Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally 
 resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it 
 unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary 
 advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be 
 benefited . <end>   4.932007632138116
<start> <start> He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , 
 and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would 
 be a very insufficient support therein . <end>   5.876710213110017
<start> <start> I rather wished , than 
 believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to 
 accede to his proposal . <end>   6.143591770618425
<start> <start> I knew that Mr . Wickham ought not to be a 
 clergyman . <end>   5.8964262360144915
<start> <start> All connection between us seemed now dissolved . <end>   3.139445984220335
<start> <start> I 
 thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his 
 society in town . <end>   7.151108893382444
<start> <start> In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his 
 studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all 
 restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation . <end>   4.520348419738158
<start> <start> For 
 about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the 
 incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied 
 to me again by letter for the presentation . <end>   6.087692405434346
<start> <start> His circumstances , he 
 assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were 
 exceedingly bad . <end>   6.975105546030639
<start> <start> He had found the law a most unprofitable study , 
 and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would 
 present him to the living in question - - of which he trusted there 
 could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other 
 person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered 
 father 's intentions . <end>   5.160894914868435
<start> <start> You will hardly blame me for refusing to 
 comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it . <end>   3.7159247241366717
<start> <start> His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his 
 circumstances - - and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me 
 to others , as in his reproaches to myself . <end>   6.670133585043217
<start> <start> After this period , every 
 appearance of acquaintance was dropt . <end>   4.4689609752978905
<start> <start> But 
 last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . <end>   3.864183959017481
<start> <start> I 
 must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget 
 myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce 
 me to unfold to any human being . <end>   4.704920353931837
<start> <start> My sister , who is more than ten years my 
 junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother 's nephew , Colonel 
 Fitzwilliam , and myself . <end>   7.077769437124501
<start> <start> About a year ago , she was taken from 
 school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last 
 summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to Ramsgate ; 
 and thither also went Mr . Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there 
 proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs . <end>   4.790497844594914
<start> <start> She was then but 
 fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her 
 imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to 
 herself . <end>   6.233144735100929
<start> <start> I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the 
 intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea 
 of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as 
 a father , acknowledged the whole to me . <end>   4.2597413688369175
<start> <start> You may imagine what I felt 
 and how I acted . <end>   7.370393586085961
<start> <start> Regard for my sister 's credit and feelings 
 prevented any public exposure , but I wrote to Mr . Wickham , who left 
 the place immediately , and Mrs . <end>   4.930885309477056
<start> <start> His revenge would have been complete indeed . <end>   4.827156597914655
<start> <start> This , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we 
 have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject 
 it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty 
 towards Mr . Wickham . <end>   4.501630038451899
<start> <start> I know not in what manner , under what form of 
 falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to 
 be wondered at . <end>   5.1692900060506295
<start> <start> Ignorant as you previously were of every thing 
 concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and 
 suspicion certainly not in your inclination . <end>   5.733961769156041
<start> <start> You may possibly 
 wonder why all this was not told you last night . <end>   4.208557231945019
<start> <start> But I was not then 
 master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . <end>   4.993893226611698
<start> <start> For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more 
 particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our 
 near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of 
 the executors of my father 's will , has been unavoidably acquainted 
 with every particular of these transactions . <end>   4.59104715845247
<start> <start> I will only add , God bless you . <end>   2.9706335312941325

 CHAPTER XIII . 
 
 
 If Elizabeth , when Mr . Darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to 
 contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of 
 its contents . <end>   6.510079717084469
<start> <start> But such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly 
 she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited . <end>   4.58073877133737
<start> <start> Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined . <end>   6.941946918440925
<start> <start> With amazement did 
 she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power ; 
 and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to 
 give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . <end>   5.876194651170711
<start> <start> With a strong 
 prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of 
 what had happened at Netherfield . <end>   5.819176232536509
<start> <start> She read , with an eagerness which 
 hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing 
 what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the 
 sense of the one before her eyes . <end>   5.076715636464134
<start> <start> His belief of her sister 's 
 insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of 
 the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have 
 any wish of doing him justice . <end>   7.057823252819417
<start> <start> He expressed no regret for what he had 
 done which satisfied her ; his style was not penitent , but haughty . <end>   4.136358197731202
<start> <start> But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr . Wickham , when 
 she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , 
 if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which 
 bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings 
 were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition . <end>   4.257970022506959
<start> <start> She wished 
 to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " This must be false ! <end>   5.12741139476741
<start> <start> This cannot be ! <end>   6.958797081701422
<start> <start> In this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on 
 nothing , she walked on ; but it would not do ; in half a minute the letter 
 was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she 
 again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham , and 
 commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . <end>   5.849846616811869
<start> <start> The account of his connection with the Pemberley family , was exactly 
 what he had related himself ; and the kindness of the late Mr . Darcy , 
 though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his 
 own words . <end>   5.938688320137506
<start> <start> So far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to 
 the will , the difference was great . <end>   4.380272657814165
<start> <start> What Wickham had said of the living 
 was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was 
 impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the 
 other ; and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did 
 not err . <end>   5.418288074033832
<start> <start> But when she read , and re - read with the closest attention , the 
 particulars immediately following of Wickham 's resigning all pretensions 
 to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three 
 thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . <end>   4.073090255208268
<start> <start> She put down the 
 letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be 
 impartiality - - deliberated on the probability of each statement - - but with 
 little success . <end>   5.989608722410173
<start> <start> On both sides it was only assertion . <end>   5.988613137702591
<start> <start> Again she read on . <end>   6.308490331923301
<start> <start> Of his former way of life , 
 nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself . <end>   7.360790991599482
<start> <start> As to 
 his real character , had information been in her power , she had never 
 felt a wish of enquiring . <end>   6.9716739843847915
<start> <start> She tried to 
 recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of 
 integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr . 
 Darcy ; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those 
 casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what Mr . Darcy 
 had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance . <end>   3.7784911053459562
<start> <start> But no 
 such recollection befriended her . <end>   5.301589812959072
<start> <start> She could see him instantly before 
 her , in every charm of air and address ; but she could remember no more 
 substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and 
 the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess . <end>   5.024997191491807
<start> <start> After 
 pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to 
 read . <end>   4.448680009988995
<start> <start> But , alas ! <end>   5.523702044727957
<start> <start> the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy , 
 received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel 
 Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before ; and at last she was 
 referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam 
 himself - - from whom she had previously received the information of his 
 near concern in all his cousin 's affairs , and whose character she had no 
 reason to question . <end>   5.525086587393306
<start> <start> At one time she had almost resolved on applying to 
 him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and 
 at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr . Darcy would never 
 have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his 
 cousin 's corroboration . <end>   6.090553971173405
<start> <start> She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation 
 between Wickham and herself , in their first evening at Mr . Philips 's . <end>   5.993833183890361
<start> <start> Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . <end>   5.212869507093464
<start> <start> She was _now_ 
 struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and 
 wondered it had escaped her before . <end>   4.300090391684184
<start> <start> She saw the indelicacy of putting 
 himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions 
 with his conduct . <end>   4.922766343556263
<start> <start> She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear 
 of seeing Mr . Darcy - - that Mr . Darcy might leave the country , but that 
 _he_ should stand his ground ; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball 
 the very next week . <end>   4.356195673527343
<start> <start> She remembered also , that till the Netherfield 
 family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but 
 herself ; but that after their removal , it had been every where 
 discussed ; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking Mr . 
 Darcy 's character , though he had assured her that respect for the 
 father , would always prevent his exposing the son . <end>   5.607813160136396
<start> <start> How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! <end>   4.801940091075749
<start> <start> His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive ; he had 
 either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying 
 his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most 
 incautiously shewn . <end>   4.693645071193185
<start> <start> Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter 
 and fainter ; and in farther justification of Mr . Darcy , she could not 
 but allow that Mr . Bingley , when questioned by Jane , had long ago 
 asserted his blamelessness in the affair ; that proud and repulsive as 
 were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their 
 acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much 
 together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing 
 that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust - - any thing that spoke him 
 of irreligious or immoral habits . <end>   4.8737417343549065
<start> <start> She grew absolutely ashamed of herself . - - Of neither Darcy nor Wickham 
 could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , 
 prejudiced , absurd . <end>   4.487795695542162
<start> <start> " How despicably have I acted ! " she cried . - - " I , who have prided myself on 
 my discernment ! - - I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! <end>   4.805259368746335
<start> <start> who have 
 often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my 
 vanity , in useless or blameable distrust . - - How humiliating is this 
 discovery ! - - Yet , how just a humiliation ! - - Had I been in love , I could 
 not have been more wretchedly blind . <end>   4.658610922358132
<start> <start> But vanity , not love , has been my 
 folly . - - Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect 
 of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted 
 prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were 
 concerned . <end>   6.015897146107784
<start> <start> Till this moment , I never knew myself . " 
 
 From herself to Jane - - from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line 
 which soon brought to her recollection that Mr . Darcy 's explanation 
 _there_ , had appeared very insufficient ; and she read it again . <end>   5.139817529787566
<start> <start> The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly 
 for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as 
 having passed at the Netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first 
 disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind 
 than on hers . <end>   5.079584794987888
<start> <start> The compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt . <end>   8.78489013423266
<start> <start> It soothed , 
 but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus 
 self - attracted by the rest of her family ; - - and as she considered that 
 Jane 's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest 
 relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt 
 by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she 
 had ever known before . <end>   5.576126526041609
<start> <start> After wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every 
 variety of thought ; re - considering events , determining probabilities , 
 and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and 
 so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her 
 at length return home ; and she entered the house with the wish of 
 appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such 
 reflections as must make her unfit for conversation . <end>   4.254543692299152
<start> <start> She was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each 
 called during her absence ; Mr . Darcy , only for a few minutes to take 
 leave , but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least 
 an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her 
 till she could be found . - - Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in 
 missing him ; she really rejoiced at it . <end>   5.078047210655501
<start> <start> Colonel Fitzwilliam was no 
 longer an object . <end>   4.779647943968796
<start> <start> She could think only of her letter . <end>   7.2787506187353275
<start> <start> Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting , that had 
 she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her 
 future niece ; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her 
 ladyship 's indignation would have been . <end>   6.459512777303995
<start> <start> Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party . - - " I assure 
 you , I feel it exceedingly , " said Lady Catherine ; " I believe nobody 
 feels the loss of friends so much as I do . <end>   5.841129187550427
<start> <start> The dear 
 colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy 
 seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year . <end>   3.6239488293871553
<start> <start> His 
 attachment to Rosings , certainly increases . " 
 
 Mr . Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which 
 were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . <end>   4.842683328298678
<start> <start> Lady Catherine observed , after dinner , that Miss Bennet seemed out of 
 spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that 
 she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , 
 
 " But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you 
 may stay a little longer . <end>   6.8152195521437475
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> I expected 
 you to stay two months . <end>   6.128288676570234
<start> <start> I told Mrs . <end>   6.677093806961193
<start> <start> Collins so before you came . <end>   5.160063844390918
<start> <start> There 
 can be no occasion for your going so soon . <end>   4.817959064178925
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet could certainly 
 spare you for another fortnight . " 
 
 " But my father cannot . - - He wrote last week to hurry my return . " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   3.045387607616716
<start> <start> And if you will stay 
 another _month_ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as 
 far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as 
 Dawson does not object to the Barouche box , there will be very good room 
 for one of you - - and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I 
 should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . " 
 
 " You are all kindness , Madam ; but I believe we must abide by our 
 original plan . " 
 
 Lady Catherine seemed resigned . <end>   4.831866261387032
<start> <start> " Mrs . <end>   9.336345297769927
<start> <start> Collins , you must send a servant with them . <end>   5.902267434180886
<start> <start> You know I always 
 speak my mind , and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling 
 post by themselves . <end>   3.7107627627360698
<start> <start> It is highly improper . <end>   4.362513005391412
<start> <start> You must contrive to send 
 somebody . <end>   4.234363890043201
<start> <start> I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of 
 thing . - - Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , 
 according to their situation in life . <end>   5.298082815390671
<start> <start> When my niece Georgiana went to 
 Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go 
 with her . - - Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr . Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady 
 Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . - - I 
 am excessively attentive to all those things . <end>   5.4096886145318805
<start> <start> You must send John with 
 the young ladies , Mrs . <end>   4.578404132781295

<start> <start> I am glad it occurred to me to mention 
 it ; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone . " 
 
 " My uncle is to send a servant for us . " 
 
 " Oh ! - - Your uncle ! - - He keeps a man - servant , does he ? - - I am very glad you 
 have somebody who thinks of those things . <end>   4.041712818653161
<start> <start> Where shall you change 
 horses ? - - Oh ! <end>   3.6398385109999385
<start> <start> Bromley , of course . - - If you mention my name at the Bell , 
 you will be attended to . " 
 
 Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , 
 and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , 
 which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her ; or , with a mind so 
 occupied , she might have forgotten where she was . <end>   5.465071258928317
<start> <start> Reflection must be 
 reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was alone , she gave way to it 
 as the greatest relief ; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , 
 in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant 
 recollections . <end>   5.636561294837723
<start> <start> She 
 studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at 
 times widely different . <end>   3.4100500056120664
<start> <start> When she remembered the style of his address , 
 she was still full of indignation ; but when she considered how unjustly 
 she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against 
 herself ; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . <end>   4.330114275184627
<start> <start> In her own past 
 behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret ; and in 
 the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin . <end>   4.0255844491570025
<start> <start> They were hopeless of remedy . <end>   3.5262290660697873
<start> <start> Elizabeth had frequently 
 united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine 
 and Lydia ; but while they were supported by their mother 's indulgence , 
 what chance could there be of improvement ? <end>   4.5442503434600585
<start> <start> Catherine , weak - spirited , 
 irritable , and completely under Lydia 's guidance , had been always 
 affronted by their advice ; and Lydia , self - willed and careless , would 
 scarcely give them a hearing . <end>   4.797029683984752
<start> <start> They were ignorant , idle , and vain . <end>   5.360549759399924
<start> <start> While 
 there was an officer in Meryton , they would flirt with him ; and while 
 Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn , they would be going there for 
 ever . <end>   5.418693205736444
<start> <start> Anxiety on Jane 's behalf , was another prevailing concern , and Mr . 
 Darcy 's explanation , by restoring Bingley to all her former good 
 opinion , heightened the sense of what Jane had lost . <end>   4.966950086901927
<start> <start> His affection was 
 proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , 
 unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his 
 friend . <end>   5.747560283239246
<start> <start> How grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so 
 desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for 
 happiness , Jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own 
 family ! <end>   5.430744330458924
<start> <start> When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham 's 
 character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had 
 seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it 
 almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . <end>   4.39175665857194
<start> <start> Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of 
 her stay , as they had been at first . <end>   5.047729252895779
<start> <start> The very last evening was spent 
 there ; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of 
 their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , 
 and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right 
 way , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the 
 work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh . <end>   5.018800807537187
<start> <start> " I know not , Miss Elizabeth , " said he , " whether Mrs . <end>   5.513268898633657
<start> <start> Collins has yet 
 expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very 
 certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for 
 it . <end>   5.008268684003368
<start> <start> The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . <end>   6.025421808253194
<start> <start> We know 
 how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode . <end>   6.484200562942043
<start> <start> Our plain 
 manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we 
 see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like 
 yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , 
 and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending 
 your time unpleasantly . " 
 
 Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . <end>   4.272659491741863
<start> <start> Mr . Collins was gratified ; and with a more smiling 
 solemnity replied , 
 
 " It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your 
 time not disagreeably . <end>   4.555390585295054
<start> <start> We have certainly done our best ; and most 
 fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior 
 society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of 
 varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that 
 your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome . <end>   4.3115376501819895
<start> <start> Our situation 
 with regard to Lady Catherine 's family is indeed the sort of 
 extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . <end>   3.31648491509849
<start> <start> You see on 
 what a footing we are . <end>   7.764428690573682
<start> <start> In 
 truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble 
 parsonage , I should not think any one abiding in it an object of 
 compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings . " 
 
 Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings ; and he was 
 obliged to walk about the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility 
 and truth in a few short sentences . <end>   5.3358481575524985
<start> <start> " You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into 
 Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . <end>   4.269658260571203
<start> <start> I flatter myself at least that you will 
 be able to do so . <end>   8.685751245820128
<start> <start> Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , 
 that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in 
 marriage . <end>   4.725626858578857
<start> <start> My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of 
 thinking . <end>   5.941368132992921
<start> <start> There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of 
 character and ideas between us . <end>   6.644652757477022
<start> <start> We seem to have been designed for each 
 other . " 
 
 Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was 
 the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed 
 and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . <end>   5.623772862921787
<start> <start> She was not sorry , however , to 
 have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from 
 whom they sprung . <end>   6.253472138997298
<start> <start> Poor Charlotte ! - - it was melancholy to leave her to 
 such society ! - - But she had chosen it with her eyes open ; and though 
 evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to 
 ask for compassion . <end>   6.317126622258992
<start> <start> Her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her 
 poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their 
 charms . <end>   5.3431406898277904
<start> <start> At length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels 
 placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . <end>   4.704958520715635
<start> <start> After an affectionate 
 parting between the friends , Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by 
 Mr . Collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning 
 her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks 
 for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his 
 compliments to Mr . and Mrs . <end>   5.9647226608776895
<start> <start> He then handed her 
 in , Maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when 
 he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had 
 hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings . <end>   5.517784407955781
<start> <start> " Good gracious ! " cried Maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but 
 a day or two since we first came ! - - and yet how many things have 
 happened ! " 
 
 " A great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh . <end>   4.459665784082912
<start> <start> " We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea there 
 twice ! - - How much I shall have to tell ! " 
 
 Elizabeth privately added , " And how much I shall have to conceal . " 
 
 Their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm ; and 
 within four hours of their leaving Hunsford , they reached Mr . Gardiner 's 
 house , where they were to remain a few days . <end>   4.621792704086356
<start> <start> Jane looked well , and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her 
 spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt 
 had reserved for them . <end>   4.846330851713217
<start> <start> But Jane was to go home with her , and at 
 Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation . <end>   5.876042893715796
<start> <start> To know 
 that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish 
 Jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own 
 vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation 
 to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision 
 in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate ; 
 and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into 
 repeating something of Bingley , which might only grieve her sister 
 farther . <end>   4.877145952897237
<start> <start> CHAPTER XVI . 
 
 
 It was the second week in May , in which the three young ladies set out 
 together from Gracechurch - street , for the town of - - - - in Hertfordshire ; 
 and , as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr . Bennet 's carriage was 
 to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman 's 
 punctuality , both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining - room up 
 stairs . <end>   5.367280661165195
<start> <start> These two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily 
 employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on 
 guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber . <end>   3.379268177332574
<start> <start> is not this an agreeable surprise ? " 
 
 " And we mean to treat you all , " added Lydia ; " but you must lend us the 
 money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . " Then shewing 
 her purchases : " Look here , I have bought this bonnet . <end>   4.374850567454153
<start> <start> I do not think it 
 is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . <end>   5.3843776967495
<start> <start> I shall 
 pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any 
 better . " 
 
 And when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect 
 unconcern , " Oh ! <end>   5.890564081619204
<start> <start> but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and 
 when I have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I 
 think it will be very tolerable . <end>   4.429939416841493
<start> <start> " They are going to be encamped near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to 
 take us all there for the summer ! <end>   5.908237706534055
<start> <start> It would be such a delicious scheme , 
 and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all . <end>   5.68892734159911
<start> <start> Mamma would like to 
 go too of all things ! <end>   7.20905410250789
<start> <start> Only think what a miserable summer else we shall 
 have ! " 
 
 " Yes , " thought Elizabeth , " _that_ would be a delightful scheme , indeed , 
 and completely do for us at once . <end>   4.623589719691171
<start> <start> Good Heaven ! <end>   8.381698546855349
<start> <start> " What do you think ? <end>   5.413818936603892
<start> <start> It is excellent news , capital news , and about 
 a certain person that we all like . " 
 
 Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he 
 need not stay . <end>   4.705705821873447
<start> <start> Lydia laughed , and said , 
 
 " Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion . <end>   5.190015763709998
<start> <start> You thought the 
 waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! <end>   7.918992562504975
<start> <start> I dare say he often hears worse 
 things said than I am going to say . <end>   3.8305252224222763
<start> <start> But he is an ugly fellow ! <end>   4.634379282632504
<start> <start> I am glad 
 he is gone . <end>   9.8158236538695
<start> <start> Well , but now for 
 my news : it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? <end>   6.629221150588445
<start> <start> There is no danger of Wickham 's marrying Mary King . <end>   4.132184753962557
<start> <start> There 's for you ! <end>   6.781757182811207
<start> <start> She 
 is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool ; gone to stay . <end>   5.794734052507025
<start> <start> Wickham is safe . " 
 
 " And Mary King is safe ! " added Elizabeth ; " safe from a connection 
 imprudent as to fortune . " 
 
 " She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . " 
 
 " But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said Jane . <end>   4.038857222302784
<start> <start> " I am sure there is not on _his_ . <end>   5.356374155950559
<start> <start> I will answer for it he never cared 
 three straws about her . <end>   3.1226784486698986
<start> <start> Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled 
 thing ? " 
 
 Elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such 
 coarseness of _expression_ herself , the coarseness of the _sentiment_ 
 was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied 
 liberal ! <end>   4.117594012584522
<start> <start> As soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was 
 ordered ; and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their 
 boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of Kitty 's and 
 Lydia 's purchases , were seated in it . <end>   5.01032920818976
<start> <start> " I am glad I bought my 
 bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox ! <end>   4.733600737093783
<start> <start> Well , now 
 let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way 
 home . <end>   4.609119286703532
<start> <start> And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , 
 since you went away . <end>   6.173613617832847
<start> <start> Have you seen any pleasant men ? <end>   3.799580405491367
<start> <start> Have you had any 
 flirting ? <end>   9.86727542553963
<start> <start> I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband 
 before you came back . <end>   4.574011973337831
<start> <start> Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . <end>   6.87307405459107
<start> <start> She is almost three and twenty ! <end>   3.855532685862008
<start> <start> Lord , how ashamed I should be of not 
 being married before three and twenty ! <end>   5.385649038883356
<start> <start> My aunt Philips wants you so to 
 get husbands , you can 't think . <end>   4.40882356525308
<start> <start> She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr . 
 Collins ; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it . <end>   4.345532738529078
<start> <start> Lord ! <end>   17.571260126690326
<start> <start> how I should like to be married before any of you ; and then I would 
 chaperon you about to all the balls . <end>   5.910215247122522
<start> <start> Dear me ! <end>   8.960767957135152
<start> <start> Kitty and me were to spend 
 the day there , and Mrs . <end>   6.426723783395116
<start> <start> Forster promised to have a little dance in the 
 evening ; ( by the bye , Mrs . <end>   5.381357175597299
<start> <start> Forster and me are _such_ friends ! ) and so 
 she asked the two Harringtons to come , but Harriet was ill , and so Pen 
 was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? <end>   4.631917596630785
<start> <start> Not a soul knew of it , but Col . <end>   6.89735792527439
<start> <start> and Mrs . <end>   8.459373543438515
<start> <start> how I laughed ! <end>   5.663162771312803
<start> <start> and so did Mrs . <end>   7.144291082019018
<start> <start> Forster . <end>   17.409449579640036
<start> <start> I thought I should have died . <end>   6.129779159628196
<start> <start> And _that_ made the men suspect 
 something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . " 
 
 With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did Lydia , 
 assisted by Kitty 's hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her 
 companions all the way to Longbourn . <end>   4.05032313149118
<start> <start> Elizabeth listened as little as she 
 could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham 's name . <end>   5.834708306505539
<start> <start> Their reception at home was most kind . <end>   5.304354332473536
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet rejoiced to see Jane 
 in undiminished beauty ; and more than once during dinner did Mr . Bennet 
 say voluntarily to Elizabeth , 
 
 " I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . " 
 
 Their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the Lucases 
 came to meet Maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects 
 which occupied them ; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table , 
 after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter ; Mrs . <end>   4.32700988779094
<start> <start> Bennet was 
 doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present 
 fashions from Jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , 
 retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases ; and Lydia , in a voice 
 rather louder than any other person 's , was enumerating the various 
 pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her . <end>   5.330946544508725
<start> <start> " Oh ! <end>   4.2396923682408225
<start> <start> Mary , " said she , " I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! <end>   4.692253729404131
<start> <start> as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended 
 there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if 
 Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we 
 behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest 
 cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have 
 treated you too . <end>   5.315688938091664
<start> <start> And then when we came away it was such fun ! <end>   4.589351929244194
<start> <start> I was ready to die of laughter . <end>   4.217035957812506
<start> <start> But I confess they would have no charms 
 for _me_ . <end>   7.015821824514792
<start> <start> I should infinitely prefer a book . " 
 
 But of this answer Lydia heard not a word . <end>   4.03322110337489
<start> <start> It should not be said , that the Miss Bennets could not be at 
 home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . <end>   8.984382368749378
<start> <start> There was 
 another reason too for her opposition . <end>   4.924977818450071
<start> <start> She dreaded seeing Wickham again , 
 and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . <end>   5.596287413114885
<start> <start> In 
 a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be 
 nothing more to plague her on his account . <end>   7.397433575406884
<start> <start> She had not been many hours at home , before she found that the Brighton 
 scheme , of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under 
 frequent discussion between her parents . <end>   4.23524613387211
<start> <start> Elizabeth saw directly that her 
 father had not the smallest intention of yielding ; but his answers were 
 at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often 
 disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last . <end>   4.492912316596699
<start> <start> CHAPTER XVII . 
 
 
 Elizabeth 's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no 
 longer be overcome ; and at length resolving to suppress every particular 
 in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , 
 she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr . 
 Darcy and herself . <end>   5.270969226072142
<start> <start> Miss Bennet 's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly 
 partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly 
 natural ; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . <end>   3.337020877308369
<start> <start> She was 
 sorry that Mr . Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so 
 little suited to recommend them ; but still more was she grieved for the 
 unhappiness which her sister 's refusal must have given him . <end>   4.74624254107652
<start> <start> You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? " 
 
 " Blame you ! <end>   6.033620233076127
<start> <start> What a stroke was this for poor Jane ! <end>   2.9386689032725943
<start> <start> who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that 
 so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here 
 collected in one individual . <end>   4.289266310238118
<start> <start> Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and 
 seek to clear one , without involving the other . <end>   3.759503578044874
<start> <start> " This will not do , " said Elizabeth . <end>   6.887001906590316
<start> <start> " You never will be able to make both 
 of them good for any thing . <end>   6.646183188494262
<start> <start> Take your choice , but you must be satisfied 
 with only one . <end>   8.436577741675347
<start> <start> There is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just 
 enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting 
 about pretty much . <end>   4.109476835090026
<start> <start> For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr . 
 Darcy 's , but you shall do as you chuse . " 
 
 It was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from Jane . <end>   6.036349449017144
<start> <start> " I do not know when I have been more shocked , " said she . <end>   4.5086807267686355
<start> <start> " Wickham so 
 very bad ! <end>   7.449369249201776
<start> <start> It is almost past belief . <end>   3.902564212778237
<start> <start> And poor Mr . Darcy ! <end>   6.538818000213119
<start> <start> dear Lizzy , only 
 consider what he must have suffered . <end>   6.866331045203674
<start> <start> Such a disappointment ! <end>   4.938748257272306
<start> <start> and with the 
 knowledge of your ill opinion too ! <end>   8.990456220480304
<start> <start> It is really too distressing . <end>   4.0522367764994165
<start> <start> I am sure you must feel it 
 so . " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   5.942392080832905
<start> <start> no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so 
 full of both . <end>   4.895565940877525
<start> <start> I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am 
 growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . <end>   3.3518557408927308
<start> <start> One has got all the goodness , and the other all the 
 appearance of it . " 
 
 " I never thought Mr . Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you 
 used to do . " 
 
 " And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike 
 to him , without any reason . <end>   4.793710686417776
<start> <start> It is such a spur to one 's genius , such an 
 opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind . <end>   4.61058351817131
<start> <start> One may be continually 
 abusive without saying any thing just ; but one cannot be always laughing 
 at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . " 
 
 " Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat 
 the matter as you do now . " 
 
 " Indeed I could not . <end>   4.839344291879339
<start> <start> I was uncomfortable enough . <end>   4.8512394455086625
<start> <start> And with no one to speak to , of what I 
 felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and 
 vain and nonsensical as I knew I had ! <end>   6.010784126144415
<start> <start> Oh ! <end>   7.296773763321134
<start> <start> how I wanted you ! " 
 
 " How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions 
 in speaking of Wickham to Mr . Darcy , for now they _do_ appear wholly 
 undeserved . " 
 
 " Certainly . <end>   3.6126678466633666
<start> <start> But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most 
 natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . <end>   4.65847659617151
<start> <start> There is 
 one point , on which I want your advice . <end>   6.988870015711926
<start> <start> I want to be told whether I 
 ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand 
 Wickham 's character . " 
 
 Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied , " Surely there can be no 
 occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . <end>   5.498955820263842
<start> <start> What is your own opinion ? " 
 
 " That it ought not to be attempted . <end>   5.316623619800703
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy has not authorised me to 
 make his communication public . <end>   4.243886953717265
<start> <start> On the contrary every particular relative 
 to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and 
 if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who 
 will believe me ? <end>   6.342881648816744
<start> <start> The general prejudice against Mr . Darcy is so violent , 
 that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to 
 attempt to place him in an amiable light . <end>   5.225879889273917
<start> <start> I am not equal to it . <end>   7.122283767546403
<start> <start> Wickham 
 will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , 
 what he really is . <end>   6.424807846161878
<start> <start> Sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we 
 may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . <end>   4.083074783625625
<start> <start> To have his errors made public might ruin him for 
 ever . <end>   3.2766247006554687
<start> <start> He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to 
 re - establish a character . <end>   5.762961209561264
<start> <start> We must not make him desperate . " 
 
 The tumult of Elizabeth 's mind was allayed by this conversation . <end>   3.9040130667613386
<start> <start> She had 
 got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , 
 and was certain of a willing listener in Jane , whenever she might wish 
 to talk again of either . <end>   6.200363600213309
<start> <start> But there was still something lurking behind , 
 of which prudence forbad the disclosure . <end>   4.634448266350933
<start> <start> She dared not relate the other 
 half of Mr . Darcy 's letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she 
 had been valued by his friend . <end>   4.842907234947484
<start> <start> Here was knowledge in which no one could 
 partake ; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect 
 understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this 
 last incumbrance of mystery . <end>   3.763400463286427
<start> <start> " And then , " said she , " if that very 
 improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell 
 what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . <end>   4.167236070588653
<start> <start> Jane was not happy . <end>   8.10862635433885
<start> <start> She still cherished a 
 very tender affection for Bingley . <end>   4.8766713837741875
<start> <start> Having never even fancied herself in 
 love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from 
 her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often 
 boast ; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to 
 every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the 
 feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those 
 regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their 
 tranquillity . <end>   5.375032809998553
<start> <start> " Well , Lizzy , " said Mrs . <end>   4.285400734143497
<start> <start> Bennet one day , " what is your opinion _now_ of 
 this sad business of Jane 's ? <end>   5.883997475701926
<start> <start> For my part , I am determined never to speak 
 of it again to anybody . <end>   6.714899397465431
<start> <start> I told my sister Philips so the other day . <end>   4.4627492832191615
<start> <start> But I 
 cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London . <end>   5.817652081651298
<start> <start> Well , he is a 
 very undeserving young man - - and I do not suppose there is the least 
 chance in the world of her ever getting him now . <end>   6.710879574292065
<start> <start> There is no talk of his 
 coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have enquired of every 
 body too , who is likely to know . " 
 
 " I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . " 
 
 " Oh , well ! <end>   5.295305360131346
<start> <start> it is just as he chooses . <end>   8.939781670098588
<start> <start> Nobody wants him to come . <end>   9.373167003984177
<start> <start> Though I 
 shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if I was 
 her , I would not have put up with it . <end>   6.52517595663634
<start> <start> Well , my comfort is , I am sure 
 Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he 
 has done . " 
 
 But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , 
 she made no answer . <end>   5.076559285193961
<start> <start> " Well , Lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the 
 Collinses live very comfortable , do they ? <end>   6.871965630116675
<start> <start> Well , well , I only hope it 
 will last . <end>   9.031679886873771
<start> <start> And what sort of table do they keep ? <end>   3.4874656854389934
<start> <start> Charlotte is an 
 excellent manager , I dare say . <end>   5.642097952990183
<start> <start> There is nothing extravagant in _their_ 
 housekeeping , I dare say . " 
 
 " No , nothing at all . " 
 
 " A great deal of good management , depend upon it . <end>   3.2323058034178636
<start> <start> Yes , yes . <end>   14.701376976413375
<start> <start> _They_ will never be distressed 
 for money . <end>   5.618241265206394
<start> <start> Well , much good may it do them ! <end>   3.7865564371026568
<start> <start> And so , I suppose , they often 
 talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . <end>   4.683530589562962
<start> <start> They look upon it 
 quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . " 
 
 " It was a subject which they could not mention before me . " 
 
 " No . It would have been strange if they had . <end>   4.8220202070594596
<start> <start> But I make no doubt , they 
 often talk of it between themselves . <end>   5.837297778854811
<start> <start> Well , if they can be easy with an 
 estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better . <end>   6.143645976611122
<start> <start> The second began . <end>   5.451086180252538
<start> <start> It was 
 the last of the regiment 's stay in Meryton , and all the young ladies in 
 the neighbourhood were drooping apace . <end>   6.1447701271490915
<start> <start> The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , 
 and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . <end>   4.182710779351429
<start> <start> Very 
 frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and 
 Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such 
 hard - heartedness in any of the family . <end>   3.8632257838495248
<start> <start> " Good Heaven ! <end>   5.188106109520608
<start> <start> What is to become of us ! <end>   7.106067587609489
<start> <start> What are we to do ! " would they 
 often exclaim in the bitterness of woe . <end>   4.476646427226452
<start> <start> " How can you be smiling so , 
 Lizzy ? " 
 
 Their affectionate mother shared all their grief ; she remembered what 
 she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years 
 ago . <end>   3.235572473817217
<start> <start> " I am sure , " said she , " I cried for two days together when Colonel 
 Millar 's regiment went away . <end>   3.0194486834809546
<start> <start> " If one could but go to Brighton ! " observed Mrs . <end>   4.527948345635187
<start> <start> " Oh , yes ! - - if one could but go to Brighton ! <end>   3.2794068464782447
<start> <start> She felt anew the justice of Mr . Darcy 's 
 objections ; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his 
 interference in the views of his friend . <end>   4.967078562112904
<start> <start> But the gloom of Lydia 's prospect was shortly cleared away ; for she 
 received an invitation from Mrs . <end>   4.087969340990849
<start> <start> Forster , the wife of the Colonel of the 
 regiment , to accompany her to Brighton . <end>   9.669473500926852
<start> <start> This invaluable friend was a 
 very young woman , and very lately married . <end>   6.38725159278457
<start> <start> A resemblance in good humour 
 and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other , and out of 
 their _three_ months 'acquaintance they had been intimate _two_ . <end>   4.5328711047814165
<start> <start> The rapture of Lydia on this occasion , her adoration of Mrs . <end>   4.304401012429023
<start> <start> Forster , 
 the delight of Mrs . <end>   8.607291587395121
<start> <start> Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely 
 to be described . <end>   7.055650212858459
<start> <start> Wholly inattentive to her sister 's feelings , Lydia flew 
 about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one 's 
 congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever ; 
 whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate 
 in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . <end>   3.9465682833705613
<start> <start> " I cannot see why Mrs . <end>   3.8573493500341467
<start> <start> Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia , " 
 said she , " though I am _not_ her particular friend . <end>   7.017325667568541
<start> <start> I have just as much 
 right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . " 
 
 In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and Jane to make 
 her resigned . <end>   7.202363541025763
<start> <start> As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from 
 exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia , that she 
 considered it as the death - warrant of all possibility of common sense 
 for the latter ; and detestable as such a step must make her were it 
 known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her 
 go . <end>   5.952311126625837
<start> <start> She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia 's general 
 behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of 
 such a woman as Mrs . <end>   5.415200213889827
<start> <start> He heard her attentively , and then said , 
 
 " Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public 
 place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little 
 expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present 
 circumstances . " 
 
 " If you were aware , " said Elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to 
 us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia 's unguarded and 
 imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you 
 would judge differently in the affair . " 
 
 " Already arisen ! " repeated Mr . Bennet . <end>   4.984300688901673
<start> <start> " What , has she frightened away 
 some of your lovers ? <end>   5.660992926310611
<start> <start> Poor little Lizzy ! <end>   6.1300426919748
<start> <start> But do not be cast down . <end>   7.306903515507355
<start> <start> Such 
 squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , 
 are not worth a regret . <end>   5.436920450816042
<start> <start> I have no such injuries to resent . <end>   4.947714108677425
<start> <start> It is not 
 of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now complaining . <end>   6.329264349519299
<start> <start> Excuse me - - for I must speak plainly . <end>   7.13571013581304
<start> <start> If you , my dear 
 father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and 
 of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of 
 her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . <end>   5.575310571376051
<start> <start> In this danger Kitty 
 is also comprehended . <end>   3.4944457842896863
<start> <start> She will follow wherever Lydia leads . <end>   3.1331304914945437
<start> <start> Vain , 
 ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled ! <end>   7.816151771654538
<start> <start> Oh ! <end>   7.296773763321134
<start> <start> my dear father , can you 
 suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever 
 they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the 
 disgrace ? " 
 
 Mr . Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject ; and 
 affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , 
 
 " Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . <end>   5.519103203306726
<start> <start> Wherever you and Jane are known , 
 you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less 
 advantage for having a couple of - - or I may say , three very silly 
 sisters . <end>   4.763306502359777
<start> <start> We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to 
 Brighton . <end>   6.827848214436062
<start> <start> Let her go then . <end>   5.503617028478838
<start> <start> At Brighton she will be of less importance 
 even as a common flirt than she has been here . <end>   4.831351211843978
<start> <start> The officers will find 
 women better worth their notice . <end>   2.9454604351661344
<start> <start> Let us hope , therefore , that her being 
 there may teach her her own insignificance . <end>   6.6979306867222315
<start> <start> At any rate , she cannot grow 
 many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest 
 of her life . " 
 
 With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content ; but her own opinion 
 continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry . <end>   4.835310575033663
<start> <start> In Lydia 's imagination , a visit to Brighton comprised 
 every possibility of earthly happiness . <end>   4.441633013281149
<start> <start> She saw with the creative eye of 
 fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers . <end>   3.812715219100404
<start> <start> She 
 saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at 
 present unknown . <end>   5.832587361199816
<start> <start> She saw all the glories of the camp ; its tents 
 stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young 
 and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet ; and to complete the view , she 
 saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six 
 officers at once . <end>   3.2735342149672064
<start> <start> Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and 
 such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ? <end>   4.770347385188256
<start> <start> They could 
 have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the 
 same . <end>   7.025853360239975
<start> <start> Lydia 's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the 
 melancholy conviction of her husband 's never intending to go there 
 himself . <end>   5.731184058493467
<start> <start> But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed ; and their raptures 
 continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia 's leaving 
 home . <end>   4.424623438736072
<start> <start> Elizabeth was now to see Mr . Wickham for the last time . <end>   8.671208720744742
<start> <start> Having been 
 frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty 
 well over ; the agitations of former partiality entirely so . <end>   2.864072334981449
<start> <start> On the very last day of the regiment 's remaining in Meryton , he dined 
 with others of the officers at Longbourn ; and so little was Elizabeth 
 disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some 
 enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford , she 
 mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam 's and Mr . Darcy 's having both spent three 
 weeks at Rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former . <end>   4.901715494742887
<start> <start> He looked surprised , displeased , alarmed ; but with a moment 's 
 recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen 
 him often ; and after observing that he was a very gentleman - like man , 
 asked her how she had liked him . <end>   5.525962202112202
<start> <start> With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " How long did you 
 say that he was at Rosings ? " 
 
 " Nearly three weeks . " 
 
 " And you saw him frequently ? " 
 
 " Yes , almost every day . " 
 
 " His manners are very different from his cousin 's . " 
 
 " Yes , very different . <end>   4.166005424434277
<start> <start> But I think Mr . Darcy improves on acquaintance . " 
 
 " Indeed ! " cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her . <end>   4.7683375366387
<start> <start> " And pray 
 may I ask ? " but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , " Is it in 
 address that he improves ? <end>   7.698810786343202
<start> <start> Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his 
 ordinary style ? <end>   3.511553127628835
<start> <start> for I dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more 
 serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials . " 
 
 " Oh , no ! " said Elizabeth . <end>   5.52949009709041
<start> <start> " In essentials , I believe , he is very much 
 what he ever was . " 
 
 While she spoke , Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to 
 rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning . <end>   4.737997652510361
<start> <start> There was a 
 something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive 
 and anxious attention , while she added , 
 
 " When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that 
 either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from 
 knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . " 
 
 Wickham 's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated 
 look ; for a few minutes he was silent ; till , shaking off his 
 embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of 
 accents , 
 
 " You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr . Darcy , will readily 
 comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume 
 even the _appearance_ of what is right . <end>   4.8870273086805645
<start> <start> His pride , in that direction , 
 may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter 
 him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by . <end>   6.766162347705886
<start> <start> I only fear that 
 the sort of cautiousness , to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , 
 is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and 
 judgment he stands much in awe . <end>   5.95603221967318
<start> <start> His fear of her , has always operated , I 
 know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his 
 wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he 
 has very much at heart . " 
 
 Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a 
 slight inclination of the head . <end>   6.008649029638295
<start> <start> She saw that he wanted to engage her on 
 the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge 
 him . <end>   5.798987994947672
<start> <start> The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_ , on his side , 
 of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish 
 Elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a 
 mutual desire of never meeting again . <end>   5.776652176431057
<start> <start> When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs . <end>   4.188010970622768
<start> <start> Forster to Meryton , 
 from whence they were to set out early the next morning . <end>   6.644109853458829
<start> <start> The separation 
 between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic . <end>   4.521539007148648
<start> <start> Kitty was the 
 only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy . <end>   5.4161886643836095
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , 
 and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the 
 opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ; advice , which there 
 was every reason to believe would be attended to ; and in the clamorous 
 happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus 
 of her sisters were uttered without being heard . <end>   5.137332892297572
<start> <start> Her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance 
 of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a 
 woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in 
 their marriage put an end to all real affection for her . <end>   4.371433919113723
<start> <start> Respect , 
 esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever ; and all his views of 
 domestic happiness were overthrown . <end>   8.755559957488117
<start> <start> He was fond of 
 the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal 
 enjoyments . <end>   4.21162983230034
<start> <start> To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as 
 her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement . <end>   4.836734991738282
<start> <start> Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her 
 father 's behaviour as a husband . <end>   7.587756634579473
<start> <start> She had always seen it with pain ; but 
 respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of 
 herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to 
 banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation 
 and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own 
 children , was so highly reprehensible . <end>   5.66093641063182
<start> <start> When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham 's departure , she found little 
 other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment . <end>   6.013443221655196
<start> <start> Their parties 
 abroad were less varied than before ; and at home she had a mother and 
 sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around 
 them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though Kitty 
 might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers 
 of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition 
 greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her 
 folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering 
 place and a camp . <end>   4.002976674629886
<start> <start> It was consequently necessary to 
 name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity ; to have 
 some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by 
 again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the 
 present , and prepare for another disappointment . <end>   4.869898271178486
<start> <start> Her tour to the Lakes 
 was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation 
 for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her 
 mother and Kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included Jane in 
 the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . <end>   6.021440707212759
<start> <start> " But it is fortunate , " thought she , " that I have something to wish for . <end>   6.738446368685193
<start> <start> Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . <end>   6.293485462216856
<start> <start> But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my 
 sister 's absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of 
 pleasure realized . <end>   5.575782427417597
<start> <start> A scheme of which every part promises delight , can 
 never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by 
 the defence of some little peculiar vexation . " 
 
 When Lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely 
 to her mother and Kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and 
 always very short . <end>   4.488166117627215
<start> <start> Forster called her , and they were going to the 
 camp ; - - and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less 
 to be learnt - - for her letters to Kitty , though rather longer , were much 
 too full of lines under the words to be made public . <end>   6.689077086442595
<start> <start> After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good 
 humour and cheerfulness began to re - appear at Longbourn . <end>   4.113658702469056
<start> <start> Everything wore 
 a happier aspect . <end>   5.554579365408741
<start> <start> The families who had been in town for the winter came 
 back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . <end>   5.363359324014432
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet 
 was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of June 
 Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without 
 tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope , that by 
 the following Christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to 
 mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious 
 arrangement at the war - office , another regiment should be quartered in 
 Meryton . <end>   4.4898747890650315
<start> <start> The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast 
 approaching ; and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter 
 arrived from Mrs . <end>   4.573797947121458
<start> <start> Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction . <end>   5.710511697683336
<start> <start> The 
 town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where 
 they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of 
 her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock , Chatsworth , 
 Dovedale , or the Peak . <end>   5.02632043407108
<start> <start> Elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing 
 the Lakes ; and still thought there might have been time enough . <end>   6.028222850806415
<start> <start> But it 
 was her business to be satisfied - - and certainly her temper to be happy ; 
 and all was soon right again . <end>   6.132979402614405
<start> <start> With the mention of Derbyshire , there were many ideas connected . <end>   4.218958201865297
<start> <start> It was 
 impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its 
 owner . <end>   4.843682731753912
<start> <start> " But surely , " said she , " I may enter his county with impunity , 
 and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me . " 
 
 The period of expectation was now doubled . <end>   3.557285387191301
<start> <start> Four weeks were to pass away 
 before her uncle and aunt 's arrival . <end>   5.268708966976842
<start> <start> But they did pass away , and Mr . and 
 Mrs . <end>   6.173935255528284
<start> <start> The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two 
 younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin 
 Jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and 
 sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every 
 way - - teaching them , playing with them , and loving them . <end>   5.187105950451804
<start> <start> One 
 enjoyment was certain - - that of suitableness as companions ; a 
 suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear 
 inconveniences - - cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure - - and affection 
 and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were 
 disappointments abroad . <end>   3.2754911434751657

 acquaintance are connected . <end>   6.444999174043114

 must own that she was tired of great houses ; after going over so many ,

 CHAPTER I . 
 
 
 Elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of 
 Pemberley Woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned 
 in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter . <end>   4.689777159693321
<start> <start> The park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . <end>   5.618752657297288
<start> <start> They 
 entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through 
 a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent . <end>   3.679733767584876
<start> <start> Elizabeth 's mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired 
 every remarkable spot and point of view . <end>   4.43810298401349
<start> <start> They gradually ascended for 
 half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable 
 eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by 
 Pemberley House , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which 
 the road with some abruptness wound . <end>   4.1803415516634255
<start> <start> It was a large , handsome , stone 
 building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high 
 woody hills ; - - and in front , a stream of some natural importance was 
 swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance . <end>   3.143267212546299
<start> <start> Its banks 
 were neither formal , nor falsely adorned . <end>   3.8727581611767237
<start> <start> She 
 had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural 
 beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste . <end>   4.149020693705087
<start> <start> They were 
 all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt , that 
 to be mistress of Pemberley might be something ! <end>   6.7303876529156765
<start> <start> She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been 
 mistaken . <end>   4.100339139742078
<start> <start> On applying to see the place , they were admitted into the 
 hall ; and Elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to 
 wonder at her being where she was . <end>   7.897021878166418
<start> <start> The housekeeper came ; a respectable - looking , elderly woman , much less 
 fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her . <end>   4.271221934446387
<start> <start> They 
 followed her into the dining - parlour . <end>   3.795177289143219
<start> <start> It was a large , well - proportioned 
 room , handsomely fitted up . <end>   3.555496383725263
<start> <start> Elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went 
 to a window to enjoy its prospect . <end>   5.884184049693916
<start> <start> Every disposition of the ground was 
 good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered 
 on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace 
 it , with delight . <end>   8.736990595822823
<start> <start> As they passed into other rooms , these objects were 
 taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to 
 be seen . <end>   2.895475924421077
<start> <start> The rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable 
 to the fortune of their proprietor ; but Elizabeth saw , with admiration 
 of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ; with less of 
 splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings . <end>   5.043550641748201
<start> <start> " And of this place , " thought she , " I might have been mistress ! <end>   7.645331247940459
<start> <start> With 
 these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted ! <end>   4.534959339724215
<start> <start> Instead of 
 viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and 
 welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . - - But no , " - - recollecting 
 herself , - - " that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost 
 to me : I should not have been allowed to invite them . " 
 
 This was a lucky recollection - - it saved her from something like regret . <end>   5.822970627952991
<start> <start> She longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really 
 absent , but had not courage for it . <end>   4.766183865614449
<start> <start> At length , however , the question was 
 asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while Mrs . <end>   6.420210656011371
<start> <start> Reynolds 
 replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to - morrow , with a 
 large party of friends . " How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own 
 journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! <end>   5.225523484022438
<start> <start> She approached , and saw 
 the likeness of Mr . Wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , 
 over the mantle - piece . <end>   4.65705742821959
<start> <start> Her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . <end>   5.593837244681708
<start> <start> Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not 
 return it . <end>   6.3617506245868105
<start> <start> " And that , " said Mrs . <end>   6.304917210062047
<start> <start> Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , 
 " is my master - - and very like him . <end>   6.888243972103407
<start> <start> It was drawn at the same time as the 
 other - - about eight years ago . " 
 
 " I have heard much of your master 's fine person , " said Mrs . <end>   4.641016472015529
<start> <start> Gardiner , 
 looking at the picture ; " it is a handsome face . <end>   7.131159651961921
<start> <start> But , Lizzy , you can tell 
 us whether it is like or not . " 
 
 Mrs . <end>   4.2942191710062865
<start> <start> Reynolds 's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this 
 intimation of her knowing her master . <end>   3.9385803437579816
<start> <start> This room was my late 
 master 's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to 
 be then . <end>   4.531475804261301
<start> <start> He was very fond of them . " 
 
 This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr . Wickham 's being among them . <end>   5.078429834467477
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy , drawn 
 when she was only eight years old . <end>   4.847266321687694
<start> <start> " And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? " said Mr . Gardiner . <end>   6.806560706957124
<start> <start> " Oh ! <end>   4.2396923682408225
<start> <start> yes - - the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so 
 accomplished ! - - She plays and sings all day long . <end>   3.6413165847729503
<start> <start> In the next room is a 
 new instrument just come down for her - - a present from my master ; she 
 comes here to - morrow with him . " 
 
 Mr . Gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her 
 communicativeness by his questions and remarks ; Mrs . <end>   3.696898900105303
<start> <start> Reynolds , either 
 from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her 
 master and his sister . <end>   5.0168532061681566
<start> <start> " Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? " 
 
 " Not so much as I could wish , Sir ; but I dare say he may spend half his 
 time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . " 
 
 " Except , " thought Elizabeth , " when she goes to Ramsgate . " 
 
 " If your master would marry , you might see more of him . " 
 
 " Yes , Sir ; but I do not know when _that_ will be . <end>   4.821161266682975
<start> <start> I do not know who is 
 good enough for him . " 
 
 Mr . and Mrs . <end>   4.979549797441697
<start> <start> Gardiner smiled . <end>   9.083661096827749
<start> <start> Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far ; 
 and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , 
 " I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him 
 ever since he was four years old . " 
 
 This was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her 
 ideas . <end>   4.7786418339911
<start> <start> If I was to go through the world , I could not 
 meet with a better . <end>   10.33448931576878
<start> <start> But I have always observed , that they who are 
 good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he 
 was always the sweetest - tempered , most generous - hearted , boy in the 
 world . " 
 
 Elizabeth almost stared at her . - - " Can this be Mr . Darcy ! " thought she . <end>   4.566057459391521
<start> <start> " His father was an excellent man , " said Mrs . <end>   6.4949539742032725
<start> <start> Gardiner . <end>   13.070694578734168
<start> <start> " Yes , Ma 'am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him - - just 
 as affable to the poor . " 
 
 Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . <end>   5.459708048391488
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Mr . Gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family 
 prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her 
 master , soon led again to the subject ; and she dwelt with energy on his 
 many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . <end>   4.414415790574238
<start> <start> Not like the wild young men now - a - days , who think of nothing but 
 themselves . <end>   4.438069515073729
<start> <start> There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will 
 give him a good name . <end>   6.14637367879049
<start> <start> " This fine account of him , " whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not 
 quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . " 
 
 " Perhaps we might be deceived . " 
 
 " That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . " 
 
 On reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very 
 pretty sitting - room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and 
 lightness than the apartments below ; and were informed that it was but 
 just done , to give pleasure to Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the 
 room , when last at Pemberley . <end>   4.541156170972058
<start> <start> " He is certainly a good brother , " said Elizabeth , as she walked towards 
 one of the windows . <end>   5.796238064189704
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy 's delight , when she should enter 
 the room . <end>   6.900767694182734
<start> <start> " And this is always the way with him , " she added . - - " Whatever 
 can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . <end>   5.475310348080502
<start> <start> In the former were many good paintings ; 
 but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art ; and from such as had been already 
 visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss 
 Darcy 's , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and 
 also more intelligible . <end>   4.43909009957336
<start> <start> In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have 
 little to fix the attention of a stranger . <end>   5.684944328905498
<start> <start> Elizabeth walked on in quest 
 of the only face whose features would be known to her . <end>   5.736238324241045
<start> <start> At last it 
 arrested her - - and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr . Darcy , with 
 such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , 
 when he looked at her . <end>   5.82674120848754
<start> <start> She stood several minutes before the picture in 
 earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the 
 gallery . <end>   6.049162939491453
<start> <start> Reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his 
 father 's life time . <end>   6.794115678661629
<start> <start> There was certainly at this moment , in Elizabeth 's mind , a more gentle 
 sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of 
 their acquaintance . <end>   5.91685274539752
<start> <start> The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs . <end>   4.129709120145242
<start> <start> Reynolds 
 was of no trifling nature . <end>   5.739988446389238
<start> <start> What praise is more valuable than the praise 
 of an intelligent servant ? <end>   4.336837183656734
<start> <start> As a brother , a landlord , a master , she 
 considered how many people 's happiness were in his guardianship ! - - How 
 much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! - - How much of 
 good or evil must be done by him ! <end>   5.626583433834152
<start> <start> Every idea that had been brought 
 forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she 
 stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes 
 upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of 
 gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and 
 softened its impropriety of expression . <end>   5.233990318791455
<start> <start> When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , 
 they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were 
 consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . <end>   6.411989292593602
<start> <start> As they walked across the lawn towards the river , Elizabeth turned back 
 to look again ; her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was 
 conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself 
 suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables . <end>   5.316976302144632
<start> <start> They were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his 
 appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . <end>   4.1577479441941625
<start> <start> Their eyes 
 instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest 
 blush . <end>   3.96791240271625
<start> <start> He absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from 
 surprise ; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , 
 and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least 
 of perfect civility . <end>   6.411192344994381
<start> <start> She had instinctively turned away ; but , stopping on his approach , 
 received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be 
 overcome . <end>   4.890397588896745
<start> <start> They stood a little 
 aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , 
 scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she 
 returned to his civil enquiries after her family . <end>   4.944088013577546
<start> <start> Amazed at the 
 alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he 
 uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the 
 impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few 
 minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most 
 uncomfortable of her life . <end>   5.52042498435746
<start> <start> Nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he 
 spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his 
 enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn , and of her stay 
 in Derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the 
 distraction of his thoughts . <end>   6.4249263551231035
<start> <start> At length , every idea seemed to fail him ; and , after standing a few 
 moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took 
 leave . <end>   4.756420423454002
<start> <start> The others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his 
 figure ; but Elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own 
 feelings , followed them in silence . <end>   5.243383796682765
<start> <start> She was overpowered by shame and 
 vexation . <end>   4.395214811778544
<start> <start> Her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill - judged 
 thing in the world ! <end>   8.08670071923535
<start> <start> It might seem as if 
 she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! <end>   5.277654306276077
<start> <start> or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? <end>   6.321285695121436
<start> <start> Had they been 
 only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his 
 discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that 
 moment alighted from his horse or his carriage . <end>   5.231490370302836
<start> <start> And his behaviour , so 
 strikingly altered , - - what could it mean ? <end>   5.7664768807873
<start> <start> That he should even speak to 
 her was amazing ! - - but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her 
 family ! <end>   6.453904673890817
<start> <start> She knew not what to think , nor how to 
 account for it . <end>   6.349351686953683
<start> <start> They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and 
 every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer 
 reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time 
 before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered 
 mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed 
 to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she 
 distinguished no part of the scene . <end>   5.003574068955132
<start> <start> She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind ; in 
 what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , 
 she was still dear to him . <end>   6.559089388225146
<start> <start> Perhaps he had been civil , only because he 
 felt himself at ease ; yet there had been _that_ in his voice , which was 
 not like ease . <end>   5.6918365628603205
<start> <start> At length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind 
 roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . <end>   4.390757306225422
<start> <start> Mr . Gardiner 
 expressed a wish of going round the whole Park , but feared it might be 
 beyond a walk . <end>   4.852273121179729
<start> <start> With a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten 
 miles round . <end>   4.815602046097044
<start> <start> It settled the matter ; and they pursued the accustomed 
 circuit ; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among 
 hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts . <end>   4.957644932154065
<start> <start> They crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of 
 the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and 
 the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the 
 stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice - wood which bordered 
 it . <end>   3.5903463845239916
<start> <start> Elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed 
 the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , Mrs . <end>   5.0315565385984735
<start> <start> Gardiner , 
 who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of 
 returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . <end>   6.8928366538974135
<start> <start> Her niece was , 
 therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house 
 on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their 
 progress was slow , for Mr . Gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the 
 taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the 
 occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man 
 about them , that he advanced but little . <end>   6.316295129897808
<start> <start> Whilst wandering on in this 
 slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth 's astonishment was 
 quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of Mr . Darcy 
 approaching them , and at no great distance . <end>   6.356324453181561
<start> <start> For a few moments , indeed , 
 she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . <end>   6.278596882571436
<start> <start> This idea 
 lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view ; the 
 turning past , he was immediately before them . <end>   3.9919298964357535
<start> <start> With a glance she saw , 
 that he had lost none of his recent civility ; and , to imitate his 
 politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place ; 
 but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when 
 some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of 
 Pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed . <end>   6.320618163843031
<start> <start> Her colour 
 changed , and she said no more . <end>   6.25723854371732
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Gardiner was standing a little behind ; and on her pausing , he asked 
 her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . <end>   7.803614219719656
<start> <start> This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared ; and 
 she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the 
 acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had 
 revolted , in his offer to herself . <end>   5.665462017590886
<start> <start> That he was _surprised_ by the 
 connexion was evident ; he sustained it however with fortitude , and so 
 far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into 
 conversation with Mr . Gardiner . <end>   4.88070679654754
<start> <start> Elizabeth could not but be pleased , 
 could not but triumph . <end>   5.643595726942841
<start> <start> It was consoling , that he should know she had 
 some relations for whom there was no need to blush . <end>   3.848881353177495
<start> <start> She listened most 
 attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every 
 expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , 
 his taste , or his good manners . <end>   6.6950141656914735
<start> <start> The conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard Mr . Darcy 
 invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he 
 chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same 
 time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of 
 the stream where there was usually most sport . <end>   4.494612178487159
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Gardiner , who was 
 walking arm in arm with Elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her 
 wonder . <end>   5.338887466210722
<start> <start> Elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly ; the 
 compliment must be all for herself . <end>   4.725181783100214
<start> <start> From 
 what can it proceed ? <end>   5.613422788912158
<start> <start> My reproofs at Hunsford could not 
 work such a change as this . <end>   5.778887374746692
<start> <start> It is impossible that he should still love 
 me . " 
 
 After walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two 
 gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the 
 brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious 
 water - plant , there chanced to be a little alteration . <end>   4.6543042742820875
<start> <start> It originated in 
 Mrs . <end>   7.134793860552486
<start> <start> Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found 
 Elizabeth 's arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred 
 her husband 's . <end>   5.30672082468498
<start> <start> She wished him to 
 know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the 
 place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been 
 very unexpected - - " for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that 
 you would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and indeed , before we 
 left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in 
 the country . " He acknowledged the truth of it all ; and said that 
 business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours 
 before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling . <end>   6.303256830917293
<start> <start> " They 
 will join me early to - morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some 
 who will claim an acquaintance with you , - - Mr . Bingley and his sisters . " 
 
 Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow . <end>   4.536551648617307
<start> <start> Her thoughts were instantly 
 driven back to the time when Mr . Bingley 's name had been last mentioned 
 between them ; and if she might judge from his complexion , _his_ mind was 
 not very differently engaged . <end>   4.696742595749062
<start> <start> She immediately felt 
 that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her , 
 must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was 
 satisfactory ; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made 
 him think really ill of her . <end>   6.547649161521607
<start> <start> They now walked on in silence ; each of them deep in thought . <end>   3.933497390634106
<start> <start> Elizabeth 
 was not comfortable ; that was impossible ; but she was flattered and 
 pleased . <end>   8.326311970878628
<start> <start> His wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of 
 the highest kind . <end>   9.094628368967538
<start> <start> They soon outstripped the others , and when they had 
 reached the carriage , Mr . and Mrs . <end>   4.800612903609316
<start> <start> Gardiner were half a quarter of a 
 mile behind . <end>   5.495383415637514
<start> <start> He then asked her to walk into the house - - but she declared herself not 
 tired , and they stood together on the lawn . <end>   6.496157484995317
<start> <start> At such a time , much might 
 have been said , and silence was very awkward . <end>   8.315610661854755
<start> <start> At last she recollected that 
 she had been travelling , and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with 
 great perseverance . <end>   4.654329826756141
<start> <start> Yet time and her aunt moved slowly - - and her patience 
 and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête - à - tête was over . <end>   3.8695467261494687
<start> <start> On 
 Mr . and Mrs . <end>   4.7428781864446306
<start> <start> Gardiner 's coming up , they were all pressed to go into the 
 house and take some refreshment ; but this was declined , and they parted 
 on each side with the utmost politeness . <end>   4.8164161375130865
<start> <start> The observations of her uncle and aunt now began ; and each of them 
 pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected . <end>   6.123317153009248
<start> <start> " He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle . <end>   4.811626739638226
<start> <start> " There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her 
 aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . <end>   6.356624208978743
<start> <start> I can now 
 say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , 
 _I_ have seen nothing of it . " 
 
 " I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . <end>   4.068673975245875
<start> <start> It was more 
 than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such 
 attention . <end>   6.105002679949536
<start> <start> But how came you to tell us that he was so 
 disagreeable ? " 
 
 Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could ; said that she had liked 
 him better when they met in Kent than before , and that she had never 
 seen him so pleasant as this morning . <end>   5.320500349612956
<start> <start> " But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , " replied 
 her uncle . <end>   7.976660470771207
<start> <start> " Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him 
 at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and 
 warn me off his grounds . " 
 
 Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said 
 nothing . <end>   4.602357884491604
<start> <start> " From what we have seen of him , " continued Mrs . <end>   6.3706879758091075
<start> <start> Gardiner , " I really 
 should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by 
 any body , as he has done by poor Wickham . <end>   6.857239703586163
<start> <start> He has not an ill - natured 
 look . <end>   4.554454677338236
<start> <start> On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when 
 he speaks . <end>   3.2298534374695214
<start> <start> And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that 
 would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . <end>   5.321427342724994
<start> <start> But he is a 
 liberal master , I suppose , and _that_ in the eye of a servant 
 comprehends every virtue . " 
 
 Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of 
 his behaviour to Wickham ; and therefore gave them to understand , in as 
 guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his 
 relations in Kent , his actions were capable of a very different 
 construction ; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor 
 Wickham 's so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire . <end>   5.347806932922104
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Fatigued as she had been by the morning 's walk , they had 
 no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former 
 acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an 
 intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance . <end>   6.099696614832556
<start> <start> The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth 
 much attention for any of these new friends ; and she could do nothing 
 but think , and think with wonder , of Mr . Darcy 's civility , and above 
 all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . <end>   7.107101148097257
<start> <start> CHAPTER II . 
 
 
 Elizabeth had settled it that Mr . Darcy would bring his sister to visit 
 her , the very day after her reaching Pemberley ; and was consequently 
 resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . <end>   5.776956896711791
<start> <start> But her conclusion was false ; for on the very morning after their own 
 arrival at Lambton , these visitors came . <end>   3.5499191376385375
<start> <start> They had been walking about the 
 place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn 
 to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a 
 carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a 
 curricle , driving up the street . <end>   6.122929486413918
<start> <start> Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt 
 that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such 
 a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece . <end>   4.640095489376119
<start> <start> She was quite amazed 
 at her own discomposure ; but amongst other causes of disquiet , she 
 dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in 
 her favour ; and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally 
 suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . <end>   4.730683265322114
<start> <start> Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction 
 took place . <end>   7.910689516980653
<start> <start> With astonishment did Elizabeth see , that her new 
 acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . <end>   4.77778455189241
<start> <start> Since her 
 being at Lambton , she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud ; 
 but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was 
 only exceedingly shy . <end>   6.31038735267747
<start> <start> She was less handsome than her brother , but there 
 was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly 
 unassuming and gentle . <end>   4.9686310652445815
<start> <start> Elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as 
 acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr . Darcy had been , was much 
 relieved by discerning such different feelings . <end>   4.64352460789074
<start> <start> They had not been long together , before Darcy told her that Bingley was 
 also coming to wait on her ; and she had barely time to express her 
 satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when Bingley 's quick step 
 was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . <end>   5.619181605468114
<start> <start> All 
 Elizabeth 's anger against him had been long done away ; but , had she 
 still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the 
 unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her 
 again . <end>   5.956933963435834
<start> <start> He enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , 
 and looked and spoke with the same good - humoured ease that he had ever 
 done . <end>   6.271839456739178
<start> <start> To Mr . and Mrs . <end>   4.587812763277066
<start> <start> Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage 
 than to herself . <end>   5.2607463329756134
<start> <start> They had long wished to see him . <end>   5.251249285959601
<start> <start> The whole party before 
 them , indeed , excited a lively attention . <end>   4.525160745105994
<start> <start> The suspicions which had just 
 arisen of Mr . Darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards 
 each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry ; and they soon drew from 
 those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what 
 it was to love . <end>   4.380243405412265
<start> <start> Of the lady 's sensations they remained a little in 
 doubt ; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was 
 evident enough . <end>   4.47436349222634
<start> <start> She wanted to ascertain the 
 feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to 
 make herself agreeable to all ; and in the latter object , where she 
 feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she 
 endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour . <end>   6.233237018282143
<start> <start> Bingley 
 was ready , Georgiana was eager , and Darcy determined , to be pleased . <end>   6.436577993282358
<start> <start> In seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister ; and oh ! <end>   6.326911564612618
<start> <start> Sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on 
 former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that 
 as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . <end>   6.346514650602062
<start> <start> But , though 
 this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour 
 to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as a rival of Jane . <end>   5.893928257228582
<start> <start> No look appeared 
 on either side that spoke particular regard . <end>   3.603861399452754
<start> <start> Nothing occurred between 
 them that could justify the hopes of his sister . <end>   5.185718819899896
<start> <start> On this point she was 
 soon satisfied ; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they 
 parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of 
 Jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that 
 might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . <end>   5.13616409707056
<start> <start> He observed to her , at a 
 moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had 
 something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had 
 the pleasure of seeing her ; " and , before she could reply , he added , " It 
 is above eight months . <end>   7.60140193196954
<start> <start> We have not met since the 26th of November , when 
 we were all dancing together at Netherfield . " 
 
 Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards 
 took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , 
 whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn . <end>   4.310134669009124
<start> <start> It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr . Darcy himself ; but , 
 whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general 
 complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far 
 removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that 
 the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however 
 temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day . <end>   5.507308150866752
<start> <start> When 
 she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion 
 of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a 
 disgrace ; when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the 
 very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last 
 lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage , the difference , the change was so 
 great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly 
 restrain her astonishment from being visible . <end>   4.786389578693569
<start> <start> Never , even in the company 
 of his dear friends at Netherfield , or his dignified relations at 
 Rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from 
 self - consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could 
 result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the 
 acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw 
 down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and 
 Rosings . <end>   4.805561932431487
<start> <start> Their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose 
 to depart , Mr . Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing 
 their wish of seeing Mr . and Mrs . <end>   5.10746715544802
<start> <start> Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , to dinner 
 at Pemberley , before they left the country . <end>   8.13620049717838
<start> <start> Miss Darcy , though with a 
 diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , 
 readily obeyed . <end>   5.9074302775489995
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing 
 how _she_ , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its 
 acceptance , but Elizabeth had turned away her head . <end>   3.6491000963149323
<start> <start> Presuming , however , 
 that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than 
 any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of 
 society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for 
 her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . <end>   6.173885650926539
<start> <start> Eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her 
 uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their 
 favourable opinion of Bingley , and then hurried away to dress . <end>   5.8675112464980925
<start> <start> But she had no reason to fear Mr . and Mrs . <end>   4.599259856623145
<start> <start> Gardiner 's curiosity ; it was 
 not their wish to force her communication . <end>   4.224218191272148
<start> <start> It was evident that she was 
 much better acquainted with Mr . Darcy than they had before any idea of ; 
 it was evident that he was very much in love with her . <end>   6.435585000138239
<start> <start> They saw much to 
 interest , but nothing to justify enquiry . <end>   6.0237700321026235
<start> <start> Of Mr . Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far 
 as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find . <end>   5.6843094411721085
<start> <start> They could 
 not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character 
 from their own feelings , and his servant 's report , without any reference 
 to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known , 
 would not have recognised it for Mr . Darcy . <end>   5.658541367928842
<start> <start> There was now an interest , 
 however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible , 
 that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four 
 years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be 
 hastily rejected . <end>   5.703253288261446
<start> <start> Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of 
 their Lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight . <end>   5.865178210106019
<start> <start> They 
 had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if 
 not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small 
 market - town , where the family did not visit . <end>   5.073095408840752
<start> <start> It was acknowledged , 
 however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor . <end>   6.268214382376425
<start> <start> With respect to Wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held 
 there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns , with the 
 son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known 
 fact that , on his quitting Derbyshire , he had left many debts behind 
 him , which Mr . Darcy afterwards discharged . <end>   4.955691744780211
<start> <start> As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than 
 the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not 
 long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion ; and 
 she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out . <end>   5.117199525294473
<start> <start> She 
 certainly did not hate him . <end>   5.203387374638605
<start> <start> No ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she 
 had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , 
 that could be so called . <end>   5.4188905525796995
<start> <start> The respect created by the conviction of his 
 valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some 
 time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings ; and it was now heightened 
 into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his 
 favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , 
 which yesterday had produced . <end>   5.091301749660902
<start> <start> It was gratitude . - - Gratitude , not merely for having once 
 loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the 
 petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the 
 unjust accusations accompanying her rejection . <end>   4.138604953815501
<start> <start> He who , she had been 
 persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this 
 accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without 
 any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where 
 their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion 
 of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . <end>   4.092151197002808
<start> <start> She respected , she 
 esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his 
 welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to 
 depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both 
 that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still 
 possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . <end>   5.707637040873238
<start> <start> It had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that 
 such a striking civility as Miss Darcy 's , in coming to them on the very 
 day of her arrival at Pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late 
 breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by 
 some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it 
 would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following 
 morning . <end>   5.562250798862228
<start> <start> Mr . Gardiner left them soon after breakfast . <end>   5.193407114383928
<start> <start> The fishing scheme had been 
 renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting 
 some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon . <end>   4.466058644009804
<start> <start> CHAPTER III . 
 
 
 Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley 's dislike of her had 
 originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome 
 her appearance at Pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with 
 how much civility on that lady 's side , the acquaintance would now be 
 renewed . <end>   5.087236357473945
<start> <start> On reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , 
 whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . <end>   3.4928430006460762
<start> <start> Its windows 
 opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody 
 hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts 
 which were scattered over the intermediate lawn . <end>   3.5567705000592778
<start> <start> In this room they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there 
 with Mrs . <end>   5.424337844229768
<start> <start> Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in 
 London . <end>   6.8285859358502945
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Gardiner and 
 her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her . <end>   8.299094787072274
<start> <start> By Mrs . <end>   8.446025184122316
<start> <start> Hurst and Miss Bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and 
 on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , 
 succeeded for a few moments . <end>   4.976043005663053
<start> <start> It was first broken by Mrs . <end>   3.3586732284848266
<start> <start> Gardiner , with occasional help from 
 Elizabeth , the conversation was carried on . <end>   7.587583808559572
<start> <start> Miss Darcy looked as if she 
 wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a 
 short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard . <end>   5.350700292193509
<start> <start> Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , 
 and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without 
 calling her attention . <end>   5.074226400415184
<start> <start> She expected every 
 moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room . <end>   4.47844899342442
<start> <start> After 
 sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing Miss 
 Bingley 's voice , Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold 
 enquiry after the health of her family . <end>   3.5672123608666806
<start> <start> The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the 
 entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the 
 finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a 
 significant look and smile from Mrs . <end>   3.3611509461887064
<start> <start> Annesley to Miss Darcy had been 
 given , to remind her of her post . <end>   8.346270307397608
<start> <start> There was now employment for the whole 
 party ; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the 
 beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected 
 them round the table . <end>   4.727104436180003
<start> <start> While thus engaged , Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether 
 she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr . Darcy , by the 
 feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but 
 a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to 
 regret that he came . <end>   6.291237598575932
<start> <start> He had been some time with Mr . Gardiner , who , with two or three other 
 gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him 
 only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to 
 Georgiana that morning . <end>   6.569118080976006
<start> <start> No sooner did he appear , than Elizabeth wisely 
 resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; - - a resolution the more 
 necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she 
 saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , 
 and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour 
 when he first came into the room . <end>   4.700266815960747
<start> <start> In no countenance was attentive 
 curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley 's , in spite of the 
 smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its 
 objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions 
 to Mr . Darcy were by no means over . <end>   4.162263912228418
<start> <start> Miss Darcy , on her brother 's 
 entrance , exerted herself much more to talk ; and Elizabeth saw that he 
 was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , 
 as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side . <end>   6.405839323870419
<start> <start> Miss 
 Bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the 
 first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , 
 
 " Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the - - - - shire militia removed from Meryton ? <end>   6.441011695683896
<start> <start> They must be a great loss to _your_ family . " 
 
 In Darcy 's presence she dared not mention Wickham 's name ; but Elizabeth 
 instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the 
 various recollections connected with him gave her a moment 's distress ; 
 but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill - natured attack , she 
 presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . <end>   3.866148419522022
<start> <start> Had Miss Bingley known what 
 pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have 
 refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose 
 Elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed 
 her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in 
 Darcy 's opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and 
 absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that 
 corps . <end>   5.799122268653619
<start> <start> Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy 's meditated 
 elopement . <end>   3.7361176110621703
<start> <start> To no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was 
 possible , except to Elizabeth ; and from all Bingley 's connections her 
 brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish 
 which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming 
 hereafter her own . <end>   5.379944787781174
<start> <start> He had certainly formed such a plan , and without 
 meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss 
 Bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern 
 for the welfare of his friend . <end>   5.049440555651027
<start> <start> Her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely 
 recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which 
 had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth , seemed to have 
 fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully . <end>   5.641055260788658
<start> <start> Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer 
 above - mentioned ; and while Mr . Darcy was attending them to their 
 carriage , Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on 
 Elizabeth 's person , behaviour , and dress . <end>   4.855369259254564
<start> <start> But Georgiana would not join 
 her . <end>   7.35409381358169
<start> <start> When Darcy returned to the saloon , Miss Bingley 
 could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to 
 his sister . <end>   6.423407153127346
<start> <start> " How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr . Darcy , " she cried ; " I 
 never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter . <end>   4.796244266077449
<start> <start> She is grown so brown and coarse ! <end>   2.6604819119500407
<start> <start> Louisa and I were agreeing that we 
 should not have known her again . " 
 
 However little Mr . Darcy might have liked such an address , he contented 
 himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than 
 her being rather tanned , - - no miraculous consequence of travelling in the 
 summer . <end>   5.525017988419691
<start> <start> " For my own part , " she rejoined , " I must confess that I never could see 
 any beauty in her . <end>   6.50780588332778
<start> <start> Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no 
 brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . <end>   4.646053687948764
<start> <start> Her nose wants 
 character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . <end>   3.7574822912589076
<start> <start> Her teeth are 
 tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which 
 have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing 
 extraordinary in them . <end>   5.217746251845024
<start> <start> They have a sharp , shrewish look , which I do not 
 like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self - sufficiency 
 without fashion , which is intolerable . " 
 
 Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , this was not 
 the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always 
 wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the 
 success she expected . <end>   5.287564834528809
<start> <start> He was resolutely silent however ; and , from a 
 determination of making him speak , she continued , 
 
 " I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all 
 were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect 
 your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , '_She_ 
 a beauty ! - - I should as soon call her mother a wit .' But afterwards she 
 seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at 
 one time . " 
 
 " Yes , " replied Darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but _that_ 
 was only when I first knew her , for it is many months since I have 
 considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . " 
 
 He then went away , and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of 
 having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . <end>   4.915762443144951
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during 
 their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested 
 them both . <end>   5.030639941658485
<start> <start> The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were 
 discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention . <end>   4.35283336882364
<start> <start> Gardiner would have been highly gratified by 
 her niece 's beginning the subject . <end>   5.263629307698029
<start> <start> CHAPTER IV . 
 
 
 Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from 
 Jane , on their first arrival at Lambton ; and this disappointment had 
 been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but 
 on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the 
 receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that 
 it had been missent elsewhere . <end>   5.900740529295109
<start> <start> They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her 
 uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by 
 themselves . <end>   4.215693867003476
<start> <start> The one missent must be first attended to ; it had been 
 written five days ago . <end>   3.810668397715591
<start> <start> The beginning contained an account of all their 
 little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; 
 but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident 
 agitation , gave more important intelligence . <end>   4.068209074589663
<start> <start> It was to this effect : 
 
 " Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of 
 a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming 
 you - - be assured that we are all well . <end>   4.382951859822916
<start> <start> What I have to say relates to 
 poor Lydia . <end>   8.424534936960658
<start> <start> An express came at twelve last night , just as we were 
 all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was 
 gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , 
 with Wickham ! - - Imagine our surprise . <end>   5.094144437381153
<start> <start> So imprudent a 
 match on both sides ! - - But I am willing to hope the best , and that 
 his character has been misunderstood . <end>   6.757522985294126
<start> <start> His choice is disinterested at least , 
 for he must know my father can give her nothing . <end>   6.670459129751739
<start> <start> Our poor mother 
 is sadly grieved . <end>   5.3111314623359895
<start> <start> My father bears it better . <end>   3.499669056275257
<start> <start> How thankful am I , 
 that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must 
 forget it ourselves . <end>   5.314314250314766
<start> <start> They were off Saturday night about twelve , as 
 is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at 
 eight . <end>   4.063176747746925
<start> <start> The express was sent off directly . <end>   3.395648888644483
<start> <start> My dear Lizzy , they must 
 have passed within ten miles of us . <end>   4.508256807789823
<start> <start> Colonel Forster gives us reason 
 to expect him here soon . <end>   4.273636948501764
<start> <start> Lydia left a few lines for his wife , 
 informing her of their intention . <end>   6.798062063197096
<start> <start> I must conclude , for I cannot be 
 long from my poor mother . <end>   7.287319289545532
<start> <start> I am afraid you will not be able to make 
 it out , but I hardly know what I have written . " 
 
 Without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing 
 what she felt , Elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the 
 other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it 
 had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . <end>   4.973933245337732
<start> <start> Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would 
 write , but I have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed . <end>   7.714716366653467
<start> <start> Imprudent as a marriage between Mr . Wickham and our poor Lydia 
 would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for 
 there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . <end>   5.889805826519256
<start> <start> F . gave them to understand that they were going to 
 Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief 
 that W . never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which 
 was repeated to Colonel F . who instantly taking the alarm , set off 
 from B . intending to trace their route . <end>   3.7260569804917663
<start> <start> He did trace them easily to 
 Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed 
 into a hackney - coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them 
 from Epsom . <end>   2.9066642987892024
<start> <start> All that is known after this is , that they were seen 
 to continue the London road . <end>   4.744611937349283
<start> <start> I know not what to think . <end>   4.484379762173451
<start> <start> After making 
 every possible enquiry on that side London , Colonel F . came on into 
 Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at 
 the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success , no such 
 people had been seen to pass through . <end>   4.309310028808346
<start> <start> With the kindest concern he 
 came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner 
 most creditable to his heart . <end>   4.84734450299652
<start> <start> I am sincerely grieved for him and 
 Mrs . <end>   5.7889586709070695
<start> <start> F . but no one can throw any blame on them . <end>   3.3902523806270044
<start> <start> Our distress , my 
 dear Lizzy , is very great . <end>   9.560964344311191
<start> <start> My father and mother believe the worst , 
 but I cannot think so ill of him . <end>   4.826857731612321
<start> <start> Many circumstances might make it 
 more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to 
 pursue their first plan ; and even if _he_ could form such a design 
 against a young woman of Lydia 's connections , which is not likely , 
 can I suppose her so lost to every thing ? - - Impossible . <end>   5.159596246148901
<start> <start> I grieve to 
 find , however , that Colonel F . is not disposed to depend upon their 
 marriage ; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he 
 feared W . was not a man to be trusted . <end>   6.534956654503395
<start> <start> My poor mother is really ill 
 and keeps her room . <end>   4.349891521712105
<start> <start> Could she exert herself it would be better , but 
 this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life 
 saw him so affected . <end>   6.790150373005674
<start> <start> Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed 
 their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot 
 wonder . <end>   3.6097339594983304
<start> <start> I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared 
 something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock 
 is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? <end>   4.51866129666406
<start> <start> Adieu . <end>   18.612025618291092
<start> <start> I 
 take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , 
 but circumstances are such , that I cannot help earnestly begging 
 you all to come here , as soon as possible . <end>   5.4630701285449685
<start> <start> I know my dear uncle and 
 aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have 
 still something more to ask of the former . <end>   8.83300815976752
<start> <start> My father is going to 
 London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her . <end>   5.462740409227133
<start> <start> What 
 he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress 
 will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest 
 way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again 
 to - morrow evening . <end>   5.372928780101648
<start> <start> In such an exigence my uncle 's advice and 
 assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately 
 comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness . " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   4.9075444433531334
<start> <start> where , where is my uncle ? " cried Elizabeth , darting from her seat 
 as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a 
 moment of the time so precious ; but as she reached the door , it was 
 opened by a servant , and Mr . Darcy appeared . <end>   6.725986786863657
<start> <start> Her pale face and impetuous 
 manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to 
 speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia 's 
 situation , hastily exclaimed , " I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . <end>   4.4343817439457744
<start> <start> what is the matter ? " cried he , with more feeling than 
 politeness ; then recollecting himself , " I will not detain you a minute , 
 but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr . and Mrs . <end>   5.154336090581888
<start> <start> You are 
 not well enough ; - - you cannot go yourself . " 
 
 Elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how 
 little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them . <end>   5.065782548160297
<start> <start> Calling back 
 the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an 
 accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and 
 mistress home , instantly . <end>   5.00676767219397
<start> <start> On his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and 
 looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , 
 or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , 
 " Let me call your maid . <end>   4.756371448203051
<start> <start> Is there nothing you could take , to give you 
 present relief ? - - A glass of wine ; - - shall I get you one ? - - You are very 
 ill . " 
 
 " No , I thank you ; " she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . <end>   4.641477722458291
<start> <start> I am only distressed by 
 some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . " 
 
 She burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could 
 not speak another word . <end>   4.3807349744702195
<start> <start> Darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say 
 something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate 
 silence . <end>   6.062343795566175
<start> <start> At length , she spoke again . <end>   6.488656932306867
<start> <start> " I have just had a letter from 
 Jane , with such dreadful news . <end>   5.481650310095331
<start> <start> It cannot be concealed from any one . <end>   4.650975153343317
<start> <start> My 
 youngest sister has left all her friends - - has eloped ; - - has thrown 
 herself into the power of - - of Mr . Wickham . <end>   4.77019216884405
<start> <start> They are gone off together 
 from Brighton . <end>   3.9174647506612645
<start> <start> _You_ know him too well to doubt the rest . <end>   4.058607916244386
<start> <start> She has no 
 money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to - - she is lost for 
 ever . " 
 
 Darcy was fixed in astonishment . <end>   5.295209876924104
<start> <start> " When I consider , " she added , in a yet 
 more agitated voice , " that _I_ might have prevented it ! - - _I_ who knew 
 what he was . <end>   5.9238278455737685
<start> <start> Had I but explained some part of it only - - some part of what 
 I learnt , to my own family ! <end>   6.032048376350087
<start> <start> Had his character been known , this could not 
 have happened . <end>   7.662517257310957
<start> <start> But is it 
 certain , absolutely certain ? " 
 
 " Oh yes ! - - They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced 
 almost to London , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to 
 Scotland . " 
 
 " And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " 
 
 " My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle 's 
 immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . <end>   4.41008832033056
<start> <start> But 
 nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done . <end>   5.914933276219877
<start> <start> How is 
 such a man to be worked on ? <end>   7.864031719592471
<start> <start> I have 
 not the smallest hope . <end>   6.741802386500218
<start> <start> " When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character . - - Oh ! <end>   4.250129246082184
<start> <start> had I known what 
 I ought , what I dared , to do ! <end>   7.960285078701059
<start> <start> Wretched , wretched , mistake ! " 
 
 Darcy made no answer . <end>   3.4298623261822634
<start> <start> He seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up 
 and down the room in earnest meditation ; his brow contracted , his air 
 gloomy . <end>   4.2707557337412005
<start> <start> Her power 
 was sinking ; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family 
 weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . <end>   3.998133430981094
<start> <start> She could neither 
 wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self - conquest brought nothing 
 consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress . <end>   4.1225238767476515
<start> <start> It 
 was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own 
 wishes ; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved 
 him , as now , when all love must be vain . <end>   5.1661481903855275
<start> <start> But self , though it would intrude , could not engross her . <end>   5.87337212890057
<start> <start> Lydia - - the 
 humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up 
 every private care ; and covering her face with her handkerchief , 
 Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else ; and , after a pause of 
 several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the 
 voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke 
 compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " I am afraid you have been 
 long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my 
 stay , but real , though unavailing , concern . <end>   5.326267106513861
<start> <start> Would to heaven that any 
 thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer 
 consolation to such distress . - - But I will not torment you with vain 
 wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . <end>   3.490665387815419
<start> <start> Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy . <end>   4.392019032096273
<start> <start> Say that 
 urgent business calls us home immediately . <end>   3.619225818898248
<start> <start> Conceal the unhappy truth as 
 long as it is possible . - - I know it cannot be long . " 
 
 He readily assured her of his secrecy - - again expressed his sorrow for 
 her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present 
 reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only 
 one serious , parting , look , went away . <end>   5.728333299409211
<start> <start> As he quitted the room , Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they 
 should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had 
 marked their several meetings in Derbyshire ; and as she threw a 
 retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of 
 contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those 
 feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would 
 formerly have rejoiced in its termination . <end>   4.1887868306516856
<start> <start> If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , Elizabeth 's 
 change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . <end>   3.7821517851431308
<start> <start> But if 
 otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or 
 unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a 
 first interview with its object , and even before two words have been 
 exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given 
 somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for Wickham , 
 and that its ill - success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other 
 less interesting mode of attachment . <end>   4.1191055136813235
<start> <start> Be that as it may , she saw him go 
 with regret ; and in this early example of what Lydia 's infamy must 
 produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched 
 business . <end>   4.420631286460244
<start> <start> Never , since reading Jane 's second letter , had she entertained 
 a hope of Wickham 's meaning to marry her . <end>   4.675184537304437
<start> <start> No one but Jane , she thought , 
 could flatter herself with such an expectation . <end>   7.713409395809775
<start> <start> But now it was all too natural . <end>   4.826232450561535
<start> <start> For such an attachment 
 as this , she might have sufficient charms ; and though she did not 
 suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the 
 intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither 
 her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy 
 prey . <end>   4.124957581475983
<start> <start> Her affections had been continually 
 fluctuating , but never without an object . <end>   4.4010512656453855
<start> <start> how acutely did she now 
 feel it . <end>   4.386893567054306
<start> <start> She was wild to be at home - - to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to 
 share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a 
 family so deranged ; a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and 
 requiring constant attendance ; and though almost persuaded that nothing 
 could be done for Lydia , her uncle 's interference seemed of the utmost 
 importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience 
 was severe . <end>   5.797437801765688
<start> <start> Mr . and Mrs . <end>   3.5178705043188505
<start> <start> Gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , 
 by the servant 's account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill ; - - but 
 satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the 
 cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on 
 the postscript of the last , with trembling energy . - - Though Lydia had 
 never been a favourite with them , Mr . and Mrs . <end>   5.291531554068285
<start> <start> Gardiner could not but be 
 deeply affected . <end>   6.540741388570649
<start> <start> Not Lydia only , but all were concerned in it ; and after 
 the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr . Gardiner readily 
 promised every assistance in his power . - - Elizabeth , though expecting no 
 less , thanked him with tears of gratitude ; and all three being actuated 
 by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily 
 settled . <end>   3.970148543757573
<start> <start> They were to be off as soon as possible . <end>   6.980751122529649
<start> <start> " But what is to be 
 done about Pemberley ? " cried Mrs . <end>   4.28487410081923
<start> <start> Gardiner . <end>   13.070694578734168
<start> <start> " John told us Mr . Darcy was 
 here when you sent for us ; - - was it so ? " 
 
 " Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . <end>   4.800466523656356
<start> <start> _That_ is all settled . " 
 
 " That is all settled ; " repeated the other , as she ran into her room to 
 prepare . <end>   6.012717321020497
<start> <start> Oh , that I knew how it was ! " 
 
 But wishes were vain ; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the 
 hurry and confusion of the following hour . <end>   4.67049233428866
<start> <start> An hour , however , saw the whole completed ; and Mr . 
 Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing 
 remained to be done but to go ; and Elizabeth , after all the misery of 
 the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could 
 have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to Longbourn . <end>   6.896321652796429
<start> <start> Could he expect that her friends 
 would not step forward ? <end>   5.684152454831705
<start> <start> Could he expect to be noticed again by the 
 regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? <end>   5.393799388534616
<start> <start> His temptation is 
 not adequate to the risk . " 
 
 " Do you really think so ? " cried Elizabeth , brightening up for a moment . <end>   4.608198351253716
<start> <start> " Upon my word , " said Mrs . <end>   4.1740366804771405
<start> <start> Gardiner , " I begin to be of your uncle 's 
 opinion . <end>   8.990396630724401
<start> <start> It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and 
 interest , for him to be guilty of it . <end>   4.575990252301424
<start> <start> I cannot think so very ill of 
 Wickham . <end>   6.91218036210994
<start> <start> Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe 
 him capable of it ? " 
 
 " Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . <end>   5.576819864873246
<start> <start> If , indeed , it should be so ! <end>   9.770297345183847
<start> <start> Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the 
 case ? " 
 
 " In the first place , " replied Mr . Gardiner , " there is no absolute proof 
 that they are not gone to Scotland . " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   5.0267624525588355
<start> <start> but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a 
 presumption ! <end>   4.575279000335204
<start> <start> And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the 
 Barnet road . " 
 
 " Well , then - - supposing them to be in London . <end>   5.64174677696832
<start> <start> They may be there , though 
 for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose . <end>   6.538367461102139
<start> <start> It is 
 not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it 
 might strike them that they could be more economically , though less 
 expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . " 
 
 " But why all this secrecy ? <end>   4.285540814554151
<start> <start> Why any fear of detection ? <end>   4.255074194322213
<start> <start> Why must their 
 marriage be private ? <end>   4.460290547091566
<start> <start> Oh ! <end>   7.296773763321134
<start> <start> no , no , this is not likely . <end>   8.102261317987535
<start> <start> His most particular 
 friend , you see by Jane 's account , was persuaded of his never intending 
 to marry her . <end>   5.893285692917089
<start> <start> Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . <end>   4.6879225142935095
<start> <start> He 
 cannot afford it . <end>   4.550385430452269
<start> <start> And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she 
 beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , 
 forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? <end>   5.058066197870362
<start> <start> As to what 
 restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a 
 dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know 
 nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . <end>   5.172748749086304
<start> <start> But as to your 
 other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . <end>   6.675791052698153
<start> <start> Lydia has no 
 brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father 's 
 behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever 
 seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _he_ would 
 do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in 
 such a matter . " 
 
 " But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , 
 as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? " 
 
 " It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied Elizabeth , with 
 tears in her eyes , " that a sister 's sense of decency and virtue in such 
 a point should admit of doubt . <end>   5.54457995017473
<start> <start> But , really , I know not what to say . <end>   5.9511134582037055
<start> <start> But she is very young ; she has never 
 been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , 
 nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement 
 and vanity . <end>   6.139731501185248
<start> <start> She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle 
 and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . <end>   4.903502077906765
<start> <start> Since the - - - - shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , 
 flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . <end>   7.07148004624298
<start> <start> She has been doing 
 every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give 
 greater - - what shall I call it ? <end>   4.742058656685985
<start> <start> susceptibility to her feelings ; which are 
 naturally lively enough . <end>   5.681673410581584
<start> <start> And who is there , whatever might be 
 their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , 
 till it were proved against them ? <end>   6.592838221616526
<start> <start> But Jane knows , as well as I do , what 
 Wickham really is . <end>   5.9780936527177495
<start> <start> We both know that he has been profligate in every 
 sense of the word . <end>   7.498304287210123
<start> <start> That he is 
 as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating . " 
 
 " And do you really know all this ? " cried Mrs . <end>   5.057570722729428
<start> <start> " I do , indeed , " replied Elizabeth , colouring . <end>   5.954161632728779
<start> <start> " I told you the other day , 
 of his infamous behaviour to Mr . Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at 
 Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved 
 with such forbearance and liberality towards him . <end>   5.441822176720287
<start> <start> And there are other 
 circumstances which I am not at liberty - - which it is not worth while to 
 relate ; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless . <end>   5.296979996039431
<start> <start> From 
 what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , 
 reserved , disagreeable girl . <end>   5.384845268592524
<start> <start> Yet he knew to the contrary himself . <end>   8.160724135068389
<start> <start> Can she be ignorant of what you 
 and Jane seem so well to understand ? " 
 
 " Oh , yes ! - - that , that is the worst of all . <end>   6.094623391642812
<start> <start> Till I was in Kent , and saw 
 so much both of Mr . Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was 
 ignorant of the truth myself . <end>   8.433034500603465
<start> <start> And when I returned home , the - - - - shire 
 was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight 's time . <end>   6.026003787701353
<start> <start> As that was the 
 case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it 
 necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it 
 apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the 
 neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? <end>   5.311080451426229
<start> <start> And even when it 
 was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs . <end>   4.064785918416922
<start> <start> Forster , the necessity of 
 opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . <end>   5.872615186795789
<start> <start> That _she_ could 
 be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . <end>   4.739895214550485
<start> <start> That such a 
 consequence as _this_ should ensue , you may easily believe was far 
 enough from my thoughts . " 
 
 " When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I 
 suppose , to believe them fond of each other . " 
 
 " Not the slightest . <end>   4.274012324597332
<start> <start> I can remember no symptom of affection on either 
 side ; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware 
 that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away . <end>   5.831383535268356
<start> <start> When first 
 he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all 
 were . <end>   7.051771207063026
<start> <start> Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him 
 for the first two months ; but he never distinguished _her_ by any 
 particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of 
 extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others 
 of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her 
 favourites . " 
 
 * * * * * 
 
 It may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added 
 to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by 
 its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during 
 the whole of the journey . <end>   5.140357815147803
<start> <start> From Elizabeth 's thoughts it was never absent . <end>   7.717891854684478
<start> <start> Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find 
 no interval of ease or forgetfulness . <end>   4.366460163166727
<start> <start> It was a 
 comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied 
 by long expectations . <end>   5.6022173220732
<start> <start> Elizabeth jumped out ; and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , 
 hurried into the vestibule , where Jane , who came running down stairs 
 from her mother 's apartment , immediately met her . <end>   4.5692009084659615
<start> <start> Elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the 
 eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been 
 heard of the fugitives . <end>   5.527548788446857
<start> <start> He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say 
 that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I 
 particularly begged him to do . <end>   6.445488108956173
<start> <start> She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you 
 all . <end>   7.187598656908114
<start> <start> She does not yet leave her dressing - room . <end>   5.558978645888119
<start> <start> Mary and Kitty , thank 
 Heaven ! <end>   3.458343609085767
<start> <start> are quite well . " 
 
 " But you - - How are you ? " cried Elizabeth . <end>   5.502744413016688
<start> <start> How much you 
 must have gone through ! " 
 
 Her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well ; and their 
 conversation , which had been passing while Mr . and Mrs . <end>   6.392620502041084
<start> <start> Gardiner were 
 engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of 
 the whole party . <end>   5.729376814423138
<start> <start> Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and 
 thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . <end>   5.520836177619161
<start> <start> When they were all in the drawing - room , the questions which Elizabeth 
 had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon 
 found that Jane had no intelligence to give . <end>   6.344179225032727
<start> <start> The sanguine hope of good , 
 however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet 
 deserted her ; she still expected that it would all end well , and that 
 every morning would bring some letter , either from Lydia or her father , 
 to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage . <end>   5.2423380249435505
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> " If I had been able , " said she , " to carry my point of going to Brighton , 
 with all my family , _this_ would not have happened ; but poor dear Lydia 
 had nobody to take care of her . <end>   5.67462517777487
<start> <start> Why did the Forsters ever let her go out 
 of their sight ? <end>   3.985758526172523
<start> <start> I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their 
 side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had 
 been well looked after . <end>   5.914760005117259
<start> <start> I always thought they were very unfit to have 
 the charge of her ; but I was over - ruled , as I always am . <end>   7.2912805890831445
<start> <start> Poor dear 
 child ! <end>   6.998436244414286
<start> <start> And now here 's Mr . Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight 
 Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is 
 to become of us all ? <end>   5.935544253044219
<start> <start> The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold 
 in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what 
 we shall do . " 
 
 They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas ; and Mr . Gardiner , after 
 general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told 
 her that he meant to be in London the very next day , and would assist 
 Mr . Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia . <end>   5.318525365057764
<start> <start> It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . <end>   5.41501347893799
<start> <start> In a few days more , we 
 may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , 
 and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as 
 lost . <end>   5.126487530478337
<start> <start> As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him 
 come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult 
 together as to what is to be done . " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   5.613804474768037
<start> <start> my dear brother , " replied Mrs . <end>   8.485932272283684
<start> <start> Bennet , " that is exactly what I 
 could most wish for . <end>   5.124624911273423
<start> <start> And now do , when you get to town , find them out , 
 wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _make_ them 
 marry . <end>   5.23688294715503
<start> <start> And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but 
 tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , 
 after they are married . <end>   5.345087191623694
<start> <start> And , above all things , keep Mr . Bennet from 
 fighting . <end>   4.012216179330647
<start> <start> Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , - - that I am frightened 
 out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , 
 such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at 
 heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . <end>   5.450760026669897
<start> <start> And tell my dear 
 Lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen 
 me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . <end>   5.361970090595159
<start> <start> Oh , brother , 
 how kind you are ! <end>   8.993846647159723
<start> <start> I know you will contrive it all . " 
 
 But Mr . Gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours 
 in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in 
 her hopes as her fears ; and , after talking with her in this manner till 
 dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the 
 housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters . <end>   6.298119781117284
<start> <start> In the dining - room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been 
 too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their 
 appearance before . <end>   4.723087064749088
<start> <start> One came from her books , and the other from her 
 toilette . <end>   7.514834505440512
<start> <start> The faces of both , however , were tolerably calm ; and no change 
 was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or 
 the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given 
 something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of Kitty . <end>   5.261078847715345
<start> <start> As 
 for Mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth 
 with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at 
 table , 
 
 " This is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of . <end>   5.368380769597866
<start> <start> But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of 
 each other , the balm of sisterly consolation . " 
 
 Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , 
 " Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful 
 lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable - - that one false 
 step involves her in endless ruin - - that her reputation is no less 
 brittle than it is beautiful , - - and that she cannot be too much guarded 
 in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . " 
 
 Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to 
 make any reply . <end>   4.131666674276325
<start> <start> Mary , however , continued to console herself with such 
 kind of moral extractions from the evil before them . <end>   5.074914958756891
<start> <start> After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel 
 of this event , which Elizabeth considered as all but certain , and Miss 
 Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible ; the former continued 
 the subject , by saying , " But tell me all and every thing about it , which 
 I have not already heard . <end>   6.6148466253447245
<start> <start> Give me farther particulars . <end>   4.314165692030278
<start> <start> What did Colonel 
 Forster say ? <end>   4.538772556237298
<start> <start> Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement 
 took place ? <end>   4.79201658016656
<start> <start> They must have seen them together for ever . " 
 
 " Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , 
 especially on Lydia 's side , but nothing to give him any alarm . <end>   5.0154978650679904
<start> <start> His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . <end>   5.8603200749681585
<start> <start> He 
 _was_ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had 
 any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension 
 first got abroad , it hastened his journey . " 
 
 " And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? <end>   3.990760267780546
<start> <start> Did he know of 
 their intending to go off ? <end>   5.708228817796313
<start> <start> He did not 
 repeat his persuasion of their not marrying - - and from _that_ , I am 
 inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . " 
 
 " And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a 
 doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? " 
 
 " How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ! <end>   4.236060704407373
<start> <start> I felt a 
 little uneasy - - a little fearful of my sister 's happiness with him in 
 marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite 
 right . <end>   7.112368565229966
<start> <start> My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how 
 imprudent a match it must be . <end>   4.304271357925348
<start> <start> Kitty then owned , with a very natural 
 triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia 's last 
 letter , she had prepared her for such a step . <end>   5.438064184704231
<start> <start> Does he 
 know his real character ? " 
 
 " I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly 
 did . <end>   5.530881477546776
<start> <start> He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant . <end>   5.732443842811069
<start> <start> We acted with the best intentions . " 
 
 " Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia 's note to his 
 wife ? " 
 
 " He brought it with him for us to see . " 
 
 Jane then took it from her pocket - book , and gave it to Elizabeth . <end>   4.760776468484846
<start> <start> These 
 were the contents : 
 
 " MY DEAR HARRIET , 
 
 " You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I cannot help 
 laughing myself at your surprise to - morrow morning , as soon as I am 
 missed . <end>   5.1909483999335055
<start> <start> I am going to Gretna Green , and if you cannot guess with 
 who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the 
 world I love , and he is an angel . <end>   6.4129483556126194
<start> <start> What a good joke it will be ! <end>   6.116855802840743
<start> <start> I shall send for my 
 clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell Sally 
 to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are 
 packed up . <end>   5.012421165711129
<start> <start> Give my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you 
 will drink to our good journey . <end>   4.515921567473499
<start> <start> " Your affectionate friend ,

 " Oh ! <end>   3.7523116822923206
<start> <start> " What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment . <end>   8.152417956752368
<start> <start> But 
 at least it shews , that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey . <end>   6.580271109942085
<start> <start> Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a 
 _scheme_ of infamy . <end>   5.926664412466306
<start> <start> My poor father ! <end>   5.936660173907244
<start> <start> how he must have felt it ! " 
 
 " I never saw any one so shocked . <end>   5.662741727268713
<start> <start> He could not speak a word for full ten 
 minutes . <end>   4.4254125432271145
<start> <start> My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in 
 such confusion ! " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   4.498607477235339
<start> <start> Jane , " cried Elizabeth , " was there a servant belonging to it , who 
 did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? " 
 
 " I do not know . - - I hope there was . - - But to be guarded at such a time , is 
 very difficult . <end>   6.288754319413791
<start> <start> My mother was in hysterics , and though I endeavoured to 
 give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much 
 as I might have done ! <end>   5.823148890166944
<start> <start> But the horror of what might possibly happen , 
 almost took from me my faculties . " 
 
 " Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you . <end>   3.9519900989069483
<start> <start> You do not look 
 well . <end>   7.177743254647342
<start> <start> Oh ! <end>   7.296773763321134
<start> <start> that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety 
 upon yourself alone . " 
 
 " Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every 
 fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them . <end>   5.292278250103293
<start> <start> Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours 
 of repose should not be broken in on . <end>   4.596987314795903
<start> <start> My aunt Philips came to Longbourn 
 on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till 
 Thursday with me . <end>   6.437074597957825
<start> <start> She was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady 
 Lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on Wednesday morning to 
 condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if 
 they could be of use to us . " 
 
 " She had better have stayed at home , " cried Elizabeth ; " perhaps she 
 _meant_ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too 
 little of one 's neighbours . <end>   5.539856209848622
<start> <start> Assistance is impossible ; condolence , 
 insufferable . <end>   7.107099994474625
<start> <start> Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . " 
 
 She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had 
 intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . <end>   5.2802674021246965
<start> <start> " He meant , I believe , " replied Jane , " to go to Epsom , the place where 
 they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could 
 be made out from them . <end>   4.986563386203189
<start> <start> His principal object must be , to discover the 
 number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . <end>   5.452274979557366
<start> <start> If he could any how 
 discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he 
 determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible 
 to find out the stand and number of the coach . <end>   4.298089552265573
<start> <start> His family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and 
 dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion . <end>   5.4669525038815125
<start> <start> They were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to 
 send , but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain . <end>   5.236224871358465
<start> <start> Mr . 
 Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off . <end>   4.681401249837227
<start> <start> When he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant 
 information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , 
 to prevail on Mr . Bennet to return to Longbourn , as soon as he could , to 
 the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only 
 security for her husband 's not being killed in a duel . <end>   6.084230493739304
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few 
 days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to 
 her nieces . <end>   5.808437061959567
<start> <start> She shared in their attendance on Mrs . <end>   4.02011461577582
<start> <start> Bennet , and was a 
 great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom . <end>   8.15471470006958
<start> <start> All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months 
 before , had been almost an angel of light . <end>   4.414873424550375
<start> <start> Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world ; 
 and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the 
 appearance of his goodness . <end>   6.757399709800249
<start> <start> That Mr . Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham , before his arrival , but 
 without gaining any satisfactory information ; and that he was now 
 determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as Mr . Bennet 
 thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first 
 coming to London , before they procured lodgings . <end>   5.960164808787181
<start> <start> Mr . Gardiner himself 
 did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was 
 eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . <end>   5.117165585082032
<start> <start> He added , that Mr . 
 Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave London , and 
 promised to write again very soon . <end>   6.365107611838602
<start> <start> There was also a postscript to this 
 effect . <end>   3.0901513710635973
<start> <start> " I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if 
 possible , from some of the young man 's intimates in the regiment , 
 whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to 
 know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . <end>   5.745549940385219
<start> <start> If there 
 were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining 
 such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . <end>   6.43980522585375
<start> <start> At present we 
 have nothing to guide us . <end>   5.332826073744721
<start> <start> Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every 
 thing in his power to satisfy us on this head . <end>   4.981437675059512
<start> <start> She had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and 
 mother , both of whom had been dead many years . <end>   6.878360781665338
<start> <start> It was possible , however , 
 that some of his companions in the - - - - shire , might be able to give more 
 information ; and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the 
 application was a something to look forward to . <end>   6.588999964685229
<start> <start> Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety ; but the most anxious 
 part of each was when the post was expected . <end>   5.6643195751855195
<start> <start> The arrival of letters was 
 the first grand object of every morning 's impatience . <end>   5.641423185376684
<start> <start> Through letters , 
 whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every 
 succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . <end>   4.721351475228698
<start> <start> But before they heard again from Mr . Gardiner , a letter arrived for 
 their father , from a different quarter , from Mr . Collins ; which , as Jane 
 had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , 
 she accordingly read ; and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his 
 letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . <end>   5.884258783067149
<start> <start> It was as 
 follows : 
 
 " MY DEAR SIR , 
 
 " I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation 
 in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now 
 suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter 
 from Hertfordshire . <end>   5.352045973007082
<start> <start> Be assured , my dear Sir , that Mrs . <end>   6.418355233419691
<start> <start> Collins and 
 myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable 
 family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest 
 kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . <end>   5.685914240098969
<start> <start> The death 
 of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . <end>   5.529260214505621
<start> <start> And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to 
 suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness 
 of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree 
 of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of 
 yourself and Mrs . <end>   6.878010554788283
<start> <start> Howsoever that may be , you 
 are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion I am not only joined 
 by Mrs . <end>   6.268740951735629
<start> <start> Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , 
 to whom I have related the affair . <end>   8.06431779501601
<start> <start> They agree with me in 
 apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be 
 injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady 
 Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves 
 with such a family . <end>   5.500673681186357
<start> <start> Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , 
 to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy 
 child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the 
 fruits of her own heinous offence . <end>   4.949718168314744
<start> <start> It was not known that Wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept 
 up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . <end>   4.625686555329363
<start> <start> His former acquaintance had been numerous ; but since he had been in the 
 militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship 
 with any of them . <end>   6.012525260113733
<start> <start> And in the wretched state of his own 
 finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to 
 his fear of discovery by Lydia 's relations , for it had just transpired 
 that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable 
 amount . <end>   5.150329881818546
<start> <start> Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would 
 be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton . <end>   3.7253211017969554
<start> <start> He owed a good deal in 
 the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable . <end>   5.895425696527828
<start> <start> Mr . 
 Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn 
 family ; Jane heard them with horror . <end>   4.586602511031126
<start> <start> " A gamester ! " she cried . <end>   5.476214892596106
<start> <start> " This is 
 wholly unexpected . <end>   5.477224315292064
<start> <start> I had not an idea of it . " 
 
 Mr . Gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their 
 father at home on the following day , which was Saturday . <end>   7.315468638810423
<start> <start> Rendered 
 spiritless by the ill - success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to 
 his brother - in - law 's intreaty that he would return to his family , and 
 leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable 
 for continuing their pursuit . <end>   5.365357794439269
<start> <start> When Mrs . <end>   8.66361661361182
<start> <start> Bennet was told of this , she did 
 not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering 
 what her anxiety for his life had been before . <end>   5.268782931603594
<start> <start> " Sure he 
 will not leave London before he has found them . <end>   5.903365807033713
<start> <start> Who is to fight Wickham , 
 and make him marry her , if he comes away ? " 
 
 As Mrs . <end>   6.292478565816307
<start> <start> Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she 
 and her children should go to London , at the same time that Mr . Bennet 
 came from it . <end>   6.030207912121168
<start> <start> Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her 
 Derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world . <end>   6.344201738415038
<start> <start> His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece ; 
 and the kind of half - expectation which Mrs . <end>   4.030974764817281
<start> <start> Gardiner had formed , of 
 their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing . <end>   6.037060231705767
<start> <start> Elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from 
 Pemberley . <end>   5.029246059967035
<start> <start> The present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for 
 the lowness of her spirits unnecessary ; nothing , therefore , could be 
 fairly conjectured from _that_ , though Elizabeth , who was by this time 
 tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , 
 that , had she known nothing of Darcy , she could have borne the dread of 
 Lydia 's infamy somewhat better . <end>   5.891489906108705
<start> <start> It would have spared her , she thought , 
 one sleepless night out of two . <end>   7.58200954871776
<start> <start> When Mr . Bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual 
 philosophic composure . <end>   6.432474759476354
<start> <start> He said as little as he had ever been in the 
 habit of saying ; made no mention of the business that had taken him 
 away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of 
 it . <end>   5.437374736859793
<start> <start> It was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that 
 Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject ; and then , on her briefly 
 expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " Say 
 nothing of that . <end>   5.001309460669439
<start> <start> It has been my own doing , 
 and I ought to feel it . " 
 
 " You must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied Elizabeth . <end>   5.552685364660904
<start> <start> " You may well warn me against such an evil . <end>   3.521032592494147
<start> <start> Human nature is so prone to 
 fall into it ! <end>   5.518286054534358
<start> <start> I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . <end>   4.8368799522293
<start> <start> It will pass away soon enough . " 
 
 " Do you suppose them to be in London ? " 
 
 " Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? " 
 
 " And Lydia used to want to go to London , " added Kitty . <end>   3.8854603364420557
<start> <start> " She is happy , then , " said her father , drily ; " and her residence there 
 will probably be of some duration . " 
 
 Then , after a short silence , he continued , " Lizzy , I bear you no 
 ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , 
 considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . " 
 
 They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother 's 
 tea . <end>   4.735716203386556
<start> <start> " This is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good ; it gives such an 
 elegance to misfortune ! <end>   4.093968240740666
<start> <start> Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in 
 my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble 
 as I can , - - or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty runs away . " 
 
 " I am not going to run away , Papa , " said Kitty , fretfully ; " if _I_ 
 should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . " 
 
 " _You_ go to Brighton ! - - I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne 
 for fifty pounds ! <end>   4.776549785601302
<start> <start> No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and 
 you will feel the effects of it . <end>   8.437367462040413
<start> <start> No officer is ever to enter my house 
 again , nor even to pass through the village . <end>   4.1617680935239605
<start> <start> Balls will be absolutely 
 prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . <end>   4.107929156238487
<start> <start> And you are 
 never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten 
 minutes of every day in a rational manner . " 
 
 Kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry . <end>   5.115153737985664
<start> <start> " Well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy . <end>   4.646118669348556
<start> <start> If you are a good 
 girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of 
 them . " 
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER VII . 
 
 
 Two days after Mr . Bennet 's return , as Jane and Elizabeth were walking 
 together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper 
 coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their 
 mother , went forward to meet her ; but , instead of the expected summons , 
 when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet , " I beg your pardon , 
 madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some 
 good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . " 
 
 " What do you mean , Hill ? <end>   5.524545211775944
<start> <start> We have heard nothing from town . " 
 
 " Dear madam , " cried Mrs . <end>   4.010262046608077
<start> <start> He has been here 
 this half hour , and master has had a letter . " 
 
 Away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech . <end>   4.901155734504518
<start> <start> They 
 ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room ; from thence to the 
 library ; - - their father was in neither ; and they were on the point of 
 seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the 
 butler , who said , 
 
 " If you are looking for my master , ma 'am , he is walking towards the 
 little copse . " 
 
 Upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , 
 and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately 
 pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock . <end>   4.572870085040788
<start> <start> Jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as 
 Elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , 
 came up with him , and eagerly cried out , 
 
 " Oh , Papa , what news ? <end>   5.478611612156428
<start> <start> what news ? <end>   9.016336550728067
<start> <start> have you heard from my uncle ? " 
 
 " Yes , I have had a letter from him by express . " 
 
 " Well , and what news does it bring ? <end>   4.748511722212278
<start> <start> good or bad ? " 
 
 " What is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from 
 his pocket ; " but perhaps you would like to read it . " 
 
 Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . <end>   4.698825565751657
<start> <start> Jane now came up . <end>   5.219740642841227
<start> <start> " Read it aloud , " said their father , " for I hardly know myself what it is 
 about . " 
 
 " Gracechurch - street , Monday , 
 
 August <NUM> . <end>   5.2697230613037815
<start> <start> " MY DEAR BROTHER , 
 
 " At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such 
 as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction . <end>   5.943064431001838
<start> <start> It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them 
 both - - - - " 
 
 " Then it is , as I always hoped , " cried Jane ; " they are married ! " 
 
 Elizabeth read on ; " I have seen them both . <end>   6.316990046526984
<start> <start> All that is 
 required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her 
 equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your 
 children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , 
 moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your 
 life , one hundred pounds per annum . <end>   5.267264338486618
<start> <start> These are conditions , which , 
 considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as 
 far as I thought myself privileged , for you . <end>   6.702193798456069
<start> <start> You 
 will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr . Wickham 's 
 circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to 
 be . <end>   6.584052535982565
<start> <start> The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to 
 say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are 
 discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . <end>   5.826929077123853
<start> <start> If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act 
 in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will 
 immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper 
 settlement . <end>   3.9276583032867958
<start> <start> There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming 
 to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on 
 my diligence and care . <end>   5.709327789344932
<start> <start> Send back your answer as soon as you can , 
 and be careful to write explicitly . <end>   4.507489620859183
<start> <start> We have judged it best , that my 
 niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will 
 approve . <end>   6.278644119059304
<start> <start> She comes to us to - day . <end>   7.469724030215796
<start> <start> Your 's , & c . <end>   3.65984591865957
<start> <start> " EDW . GARDINER . " 
 
 " Is it possible ! " cried Elizabeth , when she had finished . <end>   4.48379021056779
<start> <start> " Can it be 
 possible that he will marry her ? " 
 
 " Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; " said her 
 sister . <end>   8.636510571647397
<start> <start> " My dear father , I congratulate you . " 
 
 " And have you answered the letter ? " said Elizabeth . <end>   4.8259184641701
<start> <start> " No ; but it must be done soon . " 
 
 Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he 
 wrote . <end>   5.810979094648078
<start> <start> " Oh ! <end>   4.2396923682408225
<start> <start> my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately . <end>   7.284011241426512
<start> <start> Consider how important every moment is , in such a case . " 
 
 " Let me write for you , " said Jane , " if you dislike the trouble 
 yourself . " 
 
 " I dislike it very much , " he replied ; " but it must be done . " 
 
 And so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house . <end>   4.6680932012145275
<start> <start> " And may I ask ? " said Elizabeth , " but the terms , I suppose , must be 
 complied with . " 
 
 " Complied with ! <end>   5.349628945023188
<start> <start> I am only ashamed of his asking so little . " 
 
 " And they _must_ marry ! <end>   4.321509303667795
<start> <start> There is nothing else to be done . <end>   6.1275659781687475
<start> <start> But there 
 are two things that I want very much to know : - - one is , how much money 
 your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how I am 
 ever to pay him . " 
 
 " Money ! <end>   6.114103480745186
<start> <start> my uncle ! " cried Jane , " what do you mean , Sir ? " 
 
 " I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a 
 temptation as one hundred a - year during my life , and fifty after I am 
 gone . " 
 
 " That is very true , " said Elizabeth ; " though it had not occurred to me 
 before . <end>   5.231420939106062
<start> <start> His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! <end>   7.844002013189902
<start> <start> Oh ! <end>   7.296773763321134
<start> <start> it must be my uncle 's doings ! <end>   7.581515293718127
<start> <start> Generous , good man , I am afraid he has 
 distressed himself . <end>   6.060872941107289
<start> <start> I should be sorry to think so 
 ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . " 
 
 " Ten thousand pounds ! <end>   7.151505953418473
<start> <start> Their father then went to the 
 library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast - room . <end>   4.747815390567012
<start> <start> " And they are really to be married ! " cried Elizabeth , as soon as they 
 were by themselves . <end>   5.849417892785648
<start> <start> " How strange this is ! <end>   5.130094004923258
<start> <start> And for _this_ we are to be 
 thankful . <end>   5.096711497049005
<start> <start> That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , 
 and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! <end>   4.175474130483087
<start> <start> Oh , Lydia ! " 
 
 " I comfort myself with thinking , " replied Jane , " that he certainly would 
 not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . <end>   5.944796198158536
<start> <start> He has 
 children of his own , and may have more . <end>   7.49450390186443
<start> <start> How could he spare half ten 
 thousand pounds ? " 
 
 " If we are ever able to learn what Wickham 's debts have been , " said 
 Elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall 
 exactly know what Mr . Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has 
 not sixpence of his own . <end>   5.132368435757319
<start> <start> Their taking her home , and affording her their personal 
 protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as 
 years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge . <end>   4.483150913871572
<start> <start> By this time she is 
 actually with them ! <end>   9.429753455781883
<start> <start> If such goodness does not make her miserable now , 
 she will never deserve to be happy ! <end>   7.215355326025355
<start> <start> What a meeting for her , when she 
 first sees my aunt ! " 
 
 " We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said 
 Jane : " I hope and trust they will yet be happy . <end>   4.392257812016215
<start> <start> His consenting to marry 
 her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of 
 thinking . <end>   7.3335317115950405
<start> <start> Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself 
 they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in 
 time make their past imprudence forgotten . " 
 
 " Their conduct has been such , " replied Elizabeth , " as neither you , nor 
 I , nor any body , can ever forget . <end>   4.783150342133799
<start> <start> It is useless to talk of it . " 
 
 It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood 
 perfectly ignorant of what had happened . <end>   4.537673703516736
<start> <start> They went to the library , 
 therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to 
 make it known to her . <end>   7.4634643375260605
<start> <start> He was writing , and , without raising his head , 
 coolly replied , 
 
 " Just as you please . " 
 
 " May we take my uncle 's letter to read to her ? " 
 
 " Take whatever you like , and get away . " 
 
 Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up 
 stairs together . <end>   5.053915635603472
<start> <start> Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs . <end>   3.7717826607826415
<start> <start> Bennet : one 
 communication would , therefore , do for all . <end>   5.199969095548367
<start> <start> After a slight preparation 
 for good news , the letter was read aloud . <end>   6.236788723306223
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet could hardly 
 contain herself . <end>   4.210968286270824
<start> <start> As soon as Jane had read Mr . Gardiner 's hope of Lydia 's 
 being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence 
 added to its exuberance . <end>   4.95033037151705
<start> <start> She was now in an irritation as violent from 
 delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation . <end>   4.271695279289309
<start> <start> To know 
 that her daughter would be married was enough . <end>   7.761407105998964
<start> <start> She was disturbed by no 
 fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct . <end>   4.729157220332983
<start> <start> " My dear , dear Lydia ! " she cried : " This is delightful indeed ! - - She will 
 be married ! - - I shall see her again ! - - She will be married at sixteen ! - - My 
 good , kind brother ! - - I knew how it would be - - I knew he would manage 
 every thing . <end>   4.685336518729462
<start> <start> How I long to see her ! <end>   5.531650994593984
<start> <start> I will write to my sister Gardiner about 
 them directly . <end>   6.056667027889085
<start> <start> Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how 
 much he will give her . <end>   7.088494016349933
<start> <start> Stay , stay , I will go myself . <end>   7.499996484102052
<start> <start> Ring the bell , 
 Kitty , for Hill . <end>   11.013226071148823
<start> <start> I will put on my things in a moment . <end>   5.01237015464861
<start> <start> My dear , dear 
 Lydia ! - - How merry we shall be together when we meet ! " 
 
 Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of 
 these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr . 
 Gardiner 's behaviour laid them all under . <end>   4.5339223591175735
<start> <start> " For we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great 
 measure , to his kindness . <end>   5.284356386095042
<start> <start> We are persuaded that he has pledged himself 
 to assist Mr . Wickham with money . " 
 
 " Well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right ; who should do it but 
 her own uncle ? <end>   5.6570755486903455
<start> <start> I am so happy . <end>   5.922051879462127
<start> <start> In a short time , I shall have a daughter married . <end>   8.203664688272704
<start> <start> How well 
 it sounds . <end>   8.658545015150288
<start> <start> And she was only sixteen last June . <end>   5.49128063182471
<start> <start> We will settle with your father about the money 
 afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . " 
 
 She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and 
 cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had 
 not Jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her 
 father was at leisure to be consulted . <end>   4.737889814516575
<start> <start> " I will go to Meryton , " said she , " as soon as I am dressed , and tell the 
 good , good news to my sister Philips . <end>   6.602471694612113
<start> <start> And as I come back , I can call on 
 Lady Lucas and Mrs . <end>   7.6042438814843205
<start> <start> Long . <end>   11.797203495511495
<start> <start> An 
 airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . <end>   4.052624804376249
<start> <start> Girls , can I do any 
 thing for you in Meryton ? <end>   10.655148003431732
<start> <start> My dear Hill , have you 
 heard the good news ? <end>   5.871788387525438
<start> <start> Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall 
 all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding . " 
 
 Mrs . <end>   5.479084555877175
<start> <start> Hill began instantly to express her joy . <end>   4.1555248041605495
<start> <start> Elizabeth received her 
 congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took 
 refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom . <end>   5.398420860916009
<start> <start> Poor Lydia 's situation must , at best , be bad enough ; but that it was no 
 worse , she had need to be thankful . <end>   6.592272157311942
<start> <start> She felt it so ; and though , in 
 looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , 
 could be justly expected for her sister ; in looking back to what they 
 had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they 
 had gained . <end>   4.343712343002102
<start> <start> CHAPTER VIII . 
 
 
 Mr . Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , 
 instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for 
 the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived 
 him . <end>   5.97715393402964
<start> <start> He now wished it more than ever . <end>   5.818728008506376
<start> <start> The satisfaction of 
 prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be 
 her husband , might then have rested in its proper place . <end>   4.193088672434961
<start> <start> He was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any 
 one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother - in - law , and 
 he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his 
 assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . <end>   5.778737261979014
<start> <start> This son was to join 
 in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow 
 and younger children would by that means be provided for . <end>   4.524137075946952
<start> <start> Five daughters 
 successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come ; and Mrs . <end>   5.2736394559284925
<start> <start> Bennet , for many years after Lydia 's birth , had been certain that he 
 would . <end>   7.962503338454781
<start> <start> This event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too 
 late to be saving . <end>   5.8966702101010435
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet had no turn for economy , and her 
 husband 's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their 
 income . <end>   3.7404785080411913
<start> <start> Bennet and 
 the children . <end>   13.414037441970128
<start> <start> This was one point , with 
 regard to Lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and Mr . Bennet 
 could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him . <end>   6.341346430705905
<start> <start> In 
 terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though 
 expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect 
 approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the 
 engagements that had been made for him . <end>   4.4040311882859395
<start> <start> He had never before supposed 
 that , could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be 
 done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present 
 arrangement . <end>   5.553007439216311
<start> <start> He would scarcely be ten pounds a - year the loser , by the 
 hundred that was to be paid them ; for , what with her board and pocket 
 allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , 
 through her mother 's hands , Lydia 's expences had been very little within 
 that sum . <end>   4.795990098651729
<start> <start> That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was 
 another very welcome surprise ; for his chief wish at present , was to 
 have as little trouble in the business as possible . <end>   5.985660345547893
<start> <start> His letter was 
 soon dispatched ; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was 
 quick in its execution . <end>   4.527651344361056
<start> <start> The good news quickly spread through the house ; and with proportionate 
 speed through the neighbourhood . <end>   4.335727371118678
<start> <start> To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of 
 conversation , had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town ; or , as the 
 happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm 
 house . <end>   5.031010579235176
<start> <start> But there was much to be talked of , in marrying her ; and the 
 good - natured wishes for her well - doing , which had proceeded before , from 
 all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton , lost but little of their spirit 
 in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her 
 misery was considered certain . <end>   5.863044697591332
<start> <start> Bennet had been down stairs , but on this 
 happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in 
 spirits oppressively high . <end>   7.2489033564096745
<start> <start> No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her 
 triumph . <end>   4.62628560779517
<start> <start> The marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of 
 her wishes , since Jane was sixteen , was now on the point of 
 accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those 
 attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and 
 servants . <end>   5.460131842609977
<start> <start> She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a 
 proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering 
 what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and 
 importance . <end>   4.184137109290706
<start> <start> " Haye - Park might do , " said she , " if the Gouldings would quit it , or the 
 great house at Stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but Ashworth is 
 too far off ! <end>   4.043766137691567
<start> <start> But when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " Mrs . <end>   9.599691827602898
<start> <start> Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and 
 daughter , let us come to a right understanding . <end>   5.817814481805682
<start> <start> Into _one_ house in this 
 neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance . <end>   6.348453552081893
<start> <start> I will not encourage 
 the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . " 
 
 A long dispute followed this declaration ; but Mr . Bennet was firm : it 
 soon led to another ; and Mrs . <end>   4.8741570302609505
<start> <start> He protested that she should receive from him no mark of 
 affection whatever , on the occasion . <end>   4.550955545399772
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet could hardly comprehend 
 it . <end>   4.713366718372309
<start> <start> That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable 
 resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her 
 marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe 
 possible . <end>   4.227131578251725
<start> <start> Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of 
 the moment , been led to make Mr . Darcy acquainted with their fears for 
 her sister ; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper 
 termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its 
 unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the 
 spot . <end>   5.285569512637005
<start> <start> She had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means . <end>   4.47688977230476
<start> <start> There were 
 few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended ; 
 but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister 's 
 frailty would have mortified her so much . <end>   5.070191380071084
<start> <start> Had Lydia 's marriage been 
 concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that 
 Mr . Darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other 
 objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the 
 nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned . <end>   4.749907851378995
<start> <start> From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink . <end>   7.201648864326551
<start> <start> The 
 wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his 
 feeling in Derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a 
 blow as this . <end>   4.495491945892557
<start> <start> She was humbled , she was grieved ; she repented , though she 
 hardly knew of what . <end>   6.106356190512286
<start> <start> She wanted to hear of him , when there 
 seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . <end>   5.966095215176495
<start> <start> She was convinced that 
 she could have been happy with him ; when it was no longer likely they 
 should meet . <end>   6.59321822963221
<start> <start> What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the 
 proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now 
 have been gladly and gratefully received ! <end>   4.9123712675187505
<start> <start> But while he was mortal , 
 there must be a triumph . <end>   8.31728309145558
<start> <start> She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in 
 disposition and talents , would most suit her . <end>   4.574344384689791
<start> <start> His understanding and 
 temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . <end>   6.94180448380668
<start> <start> It 
 was an union that must have been to the advantage of both ; by her ease 
 and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , 
 and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must 
 have received benefit of greater importance . <end>   5.937249951571752
<start> <start> But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what 
 connubial felicity really was . <end>   2.406419686303191
<start> <start> An union of a different tendency , and 
 precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their 
 family . <end>   7.682515435256868
<start> <start> But how little of permanent happiness could 
 belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions 
 were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . <end>   3.3313023222931637
<start> <start> * * * * * 
 
 Mr . Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . <end>   4.345187892740415
<start> <start> To Mr . Bennet 's 
 acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to 
 promote the welfare of any of his family ; and concluded with intreaties 
 that the subject might never be mentioned to him again . <end>   6.889737297859906
<start> <start> The principal 
 purport of his letter was to inform them , that Mr . Wickham had resolved 
 on quitting the Militia . <end>   5.19768585653891
<start> <start> " It was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon 
 as his marriage was fixed on . <end>   5.704262937349756
<start> <start> And I think you will agree with me , 
 in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both 
 on his account and my niece 's . <end>   4.767650717379115
<start> <start> It is Mr . Wickham 's intention to go 
 into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still 
 some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . <end>   4.894638290887839
<start> <start> He has the 
 promise of an ensigncy in General - - - - 's regiment , now quartered in 
 the North . <end>   5.30625700947757
<start> <start> It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of 
 the kingdom . <end>   7.284680014673082
<start> <start> He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , 
 where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be 
 more prudent . <end>   5.241552291273399
<start> <start> He has given in all his debts ; I hope 
 at least he has not deceived us . <end>   5.708668263688226
<start> <start> Haggerston has our directions , and 
 all will be completed in a week . <end>   7.400446916281107
<start> <start> Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , 
 before she leaves the South . <end>   6.398685203034861
<start> <start> She is well , and begs to be dutifully 
 remembered to you and her mother . - - Your 's , & c . <end>   6.338310449335065
<start> <start> " E . GARDINER . " 
 
 Mr . Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham 's removal 
 from the - - - - shire , as clearly as Mr . Gardiner could do . <end>   5.532142709664895
<start> <start> But Mrs . <end>   6.902327267283384
<start> <start> Bennet , was not so well pleased with it . <end>   8.937941368437821
<start> <start> Lydia 's being settled in the 
 North , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her 
 company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in 
 Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment ; and besides , it was such a 
 pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted 
 with every body , and had so many favourites . <end>   5.739333776716082
<start> <start> And there are several of the young men , too , that she 
 likes very much . <end>   5.798699610858661
<start> <start> The officers may not be so pleasant in General - - - - 's 
 regiment . " 
 
 His daughter 's request , for such it might be considered , of being 
 admitted into her family again , before she set off for the North , 
 received at first an absolute negative . <end>   5.2871517390007
<start> <start> But Jane and Elizabeth , who 
 agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister 's feelings and 
 consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , 
 urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her 
 and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was 
 prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . <end>   6.146152929158286
<start> <start> And their 
 mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew 
 her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to 
 the North . <end>   6.779009861714792
<start> <start> When Mr . Bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he 
 sent his permission for them to come ; and it was settled , that as soon 
 as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to Longbourn . <end>   5.9481154843721
<start> <start> CHAPTER IX . 
 
 
 Their sister 's wedding day arrived ; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her 
 probably more than she felt for herself . <end>   6.7172156930726485
<start> <start> The carriage was sent to meet 
 them at - - - - , and they were to return in it , by dinner - time . <end>   7.992140336986067
<start> <start> They came . <end>   9.055853648625504
<start> <start> The family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive 
 them . <end>   7.060331077780776
<start> <start> Smiles decked the face of Mrs . <end>   3.565251501994269
<start> <start> Bennet , as the carriage drove up to 
 the door ; her husband looked impenetrably grave ; her daughters , alarmed , 
 anxious , uneasy . <end>   5.958363520147987
<start> <start> Their reception from Mr . Bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite 
 so cordial . <end>   5.146313440844704
<start> <start> His countenance rather gained in austerity ; and he scarcely 
 opened his lips . <end>   3.3754816224466455
<start> <start> Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was 
 shocked . <end>   7.937075803268013
<start> <start> Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners 
 were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been 
 exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he 
 claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . <end>   5.914089304715855
<start> <start> Elizabeth had 
 not before believed him quite equal to such assurance ; but she sat down , 
 resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence 
 of an impudent man . <end>   5.308761707216567
<start> <start> _She_ blushed , and Jane blushed ; but the cheeks of 
 the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour . <end>   4.236620179158929
<start> <start> The bride and her mother could neither 
 of them talk fast enough ; and Wickham , who happened to sit near 
 Elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , 
 with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her 
 replies . <end>   6.694565745699692
<start> <start> Nothing of the past was recollected with pain ; and Lydia led 
 voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for 
 the world . <end>   5.213716343818529
<start> <start> " Only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since I went away ; 
 it seems but a fortnight I declare ; and yet there have been things 
 enough happened in the time . <end>   6.590292576676466
<start> <start> Good gracious ! <end>   9.36872298911601
<start> <start> Jane was distressed . <end>   5.4895874005045355
<start> <start> mamma , do the 
 people here abouts know I am married to - day ? <end>   7.685035559161492
<start> <start> I was afraid they might 
 not ; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was 
 determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to 
 him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window 
 frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like 
 any thing . " 
 
 Elizabeth could bear it no longer . <end>   4.5202824830532
<start> <start> She got up , and ran out of the room ; 
 and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to 
 the dining - parlour . <end>   5.76091223411319
<start> <start> She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with 
 anxious parade , walk up to her mother 's right hand , and hear her say to 
 her eldest sister , " Ah ! <end>   6.705719675806961
<start> <start> Jane , I take your place now , and you must go 
 lower , because I am a married woman . " 
 
 It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment , 
 from which she had been so wholly free at first . <end>   4.815878563364184
<start> <start> Philips , the Lucases , and all 
 their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " Mrs . <end>   7.292648971735344
<start> <start> Wickham , " by 
 each of them ; and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her 
 ring and boast of being married , to Mrs . <end>   7.064663548151601
<start> <start> " Well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast 
 room , " and what do you think of my husband ? <end>   5.848170862893206
<start> <start> Is not he a charming man ? <end>   4.201750268135345
<start> <start> I only hope they may have half my 
 good luck . <end>   4.592456974945818
<start> <start> That is the place to get 
 husbands . <end>   9.898437879101946
<start> <start> Must it be so ? " 
 
 " Oh , lord ! <end>   4.625798729161741
<start> <start> yes ; - - there is nothing in that . <end>   9.852365902840202
<start> <start> I shall like it of all 
 things . <end>   6.517024881700951
<start> <start> You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . <end>   5.444248160504535
<start> <start> We 
 shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some 
 balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . " 
 
 " I should like it beyond any thing ! " said her mother . <end>   5.198223888098502
<start> <start> " And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters 
 behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the 
 winter is over . " 
 
 " I thank you for my share of the favour , " said Elizabeth ; " but I do not 
 particularly like your way of getting husbands . " 
 
 Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . <end>   4.499073296647932
<start> <start> Bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short ; and 
 she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and 
 having very frequent parties at home . <end>   6.181130233697663
<start> <start> These parties were acceptable to 
 all ; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did 
 think , than such as did not . <end>   5.244772931717344
<start> <start> She had scarcely needed her 
 present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that 
 their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather 
 than by his ; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring 
 for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain 
 that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances ; and 
 if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity 
 of having a companion . <end>   5.657853170138337
<start> <start> Lydia was exceedingly fond of him . <end>   6.467717242629682
<start> <start> He was her dear Wickham on every 
 occasion ; no one was to be put in competition with him . <end>   4.1621161564089455
<start> <start> He did every 
 thing best in the world ; and she was sure he would kill more birds on 
 the first of September , than any body else in the country . <end>   4.7084643824471435
<start> <start> One morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two 
 elder sisters , she said to Elizabeth , 
 
 " Lizzy , I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding , I believe . <end>   6.099607933195076
<start> <start> You are so strange ! <end>   7.658453205273217
<start> <start> But I must tell you how it went off . <end>   4.531207266387552
<start> <start> We were 
 married , you know , at St . Clement 's , because Wickham 's lodgings were in 
 that parish . <end>   7.086755911468132
<start> <start> And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven 
 o 'clock . <end>   3.0946377881035345
<start> <start> My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others 
 were to meet us at the church . <end>   8.751030848615597
<start> <start> Well , Monday morning came , and I was in 
 such a fuss ! <end>   6.7743384403511735
<start> <start> I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put 
 it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . <end>   5.5871000943925875
<start> <start> And there was my 
 aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if 
 she was reading a sermon . <end>   5.456271614561673
<start> <start> However , I did not hear above one word in ten , 
 for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . <end>   7.364980262823449
<start> <start> I longed to 
 know whether he would be married in his blue coat . <end>   7.276389334252473
<start> <start> " Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; I thought it would never 
 be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt 
 were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . <end>   5.135012047130339
<start> <start> If you 'll believe 
 me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a 
 fortnight . <end>   4.626961626911838
<start> <start> Not one party , or scheme , or any thing . <end>   7.084531302704955
<start> <start> To be sure London was 
 rather thin , but however the little Theatre was open . <end>   4.304433812707777
<start> <start> Well , and so just 
 as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business 
 to that horrid man Mr . Stone . <end>   6.7715830968380715
<start> <start> And then , you know , when once they get 
 together , there is no end of it . <end>   5.629916135390513
<start> <start> But , luckily , he came back 
 again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . <end>   5.166397852542093
<start> <start> However , I 
 recollected afterwards , that if he _had_ been prevented going , the 
 wedding need not be put off , for Mr . Darcy might have done as well . " 
 
 " Mr . Darcy ! " repeated Elizabeth , in utter amazement . <end>   5.57365432010986
<start> <start> " Oh , yes ! - - he was to come there with Wickham , you know . <end>   5.4866366109067215
<start> <start> But gracious me ! <end>   5.861732234318703
<start> <start> I quite forgot ! <end>   5.492789053051742
<start> <start> I ought not to have said a word about it . <end>   7.440284751137019
<start> <start> I promised 
 them so faithfully ! <end>   5.83935643127739
<start> <start> What will Wickham say ? <end>   4.159989647632104
<start> <start> It was to be such a secret ! " 
 
 " If it was to be secret , " said Jane , " say not another word on the 
 subject . <end>   5.741815265119266
<start> <start> You may depend upon my seeking no further . " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   2.5843378305214824
<start> <start> It was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , 
 where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . <end>   6.09770491749758
<start> <start> Conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her 
 brain ; but she was satisfied with none . <end>   5.405143137888371
<start> <start> Those that best pleased her , as 
 placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable . <end>   4.4550374362569105
<start> <start> She 
 could not bear such suspense ; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , 
 wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what 
 Lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been 
 intended . <end>   4.572219344902498
<start> <start> " You may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to 
 know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively 
 speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such 
 a time . <end>   4.804911045294178
<start> <start> Pray write instantly , and let me understand it - - unless it is , 
 for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to 
 think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with 
 ignorance . " 
 
 " Not that I _shall_ though , " she added to herself , as she finished the 
 letter ; " and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable 
 manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it 
 out . " 
 
 Jane 's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to 
 Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall ; Elizabeth was glad of 
 it ; - - till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any 
 satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . <end>   5.523131460144525
<start> <start> She was no sooner in possession of it , than 
 hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be 
 interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be 
 happy ; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not 
 contain a denial . <end>   6.884228990070601
<start> <start> " Gracechurch - street , Sept . <end>   3.954992360321375
<start> <start> <NUM> . <end>   8.535568287506464
<start> <start> " MY DEAR NIECE , 
 
 " I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole 
 morning to answering it , as I foresee that a _little_ writing will 
 not comprise what I have to tell you . <end>   4.024821908156574
<start> <start> I must confess myself 
 surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from _you_ . <end>   4.380226222476056
<start> <start> Don 't think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , 
 that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_ 
 side . <end>   4.517764055931268
<start> <start> If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my 
 impertinence . <end>   5.477746061201935
<start> <start> But if you are really innocent and 
 ignorant , I must be more explicit . <end>   8.286862579931162
<start> <start> On the very day of my coming 
 home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . <end>   4.910265777650625
<start> <start> Mr . 
 Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . <end>   5.059065473475547
<start> <start> It was all 
 over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked 
 as _your 's_ seems to have been . <end>   3.8639379207340228
<start> <start> He came to tell Mr . Gardiner that 
 he had found out where your sister and Mr . Wickham were , and that 
 he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia 
 once . <end>   6.010098542888857
<start> <start> From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day 
 after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting 
 for them . <end>   6.810773707441178
<start> <start> The motive professed , was his conviction of its being 
 owing to himself that Wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well 
 known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , 
 to love or confide in him . <end>   4.7901989570096015
<start> <start> He generously imputed the whole to his 
 mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath 
 him , to lay his private actions open to the world . <end>   5.490395036802217
<start> <start> His character 
 was to speak for itself . <end>   8.174020817060388
<start> <start> He called it , therefore , his duty to step 
 forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on 
 by himself . <end>   6.018104968176453
<start> <start> If he _had another_ motive , I am sure it would never 
 disgrace him . <end>   4.926193549920126
<start> <start> He had been some days in town , before he was able to 
 discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was 
 more than _we_ had ; and the consciousness of this , was another 
 reason for his resolving to follow us . <end>   6.091067356617068
<start> <start> There is a lady , it seems , a 
 Mrs . <end>   7.648125776698548
<start> <start> Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was 
 dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though 
 he did not say what . <end>   4.898139500836299
<start> <start> She then took a large house in Edward - street , 
 and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . <end>   3.2959163031754377
<start> <start> This Mrs . <end>   8.620903141446982
<start> <start> But 
 it was two or three days before he could get from her what he 
 wanted . <end>   5.947503399207014
<start> <start> She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery 
 and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be 
 found . <end>   4.9689939818701125
<start> <start> At length , however , our 
 kind friend procured the wished - for direction . <end>   2.9295168774341587
<start> <start> They were in - - - - 
 street . <end>   9.692797138860497
<start> <start> He saw Wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia . <end>   5.1652802626814625
<start> <start> His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade 
 her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her 
 friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , 
 offering his assistance , as far as it would go . <end>   7.010840652696243
<start> <start> But he found Lydia 
 absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . <end>   3.1471241466893125
<start> <start> She cared for none 
 of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of 
 leaving Wickham . <end>   6.454792674236862
<start> <start> She was sure they should be married some time or 
 other , and it did not much signify when . <end>   5.791149134268976
<start> <start> Since such were her 
 feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a 
 marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he 
 easily learnt , had never been _his_ design . <end>   5.912228343648812
<start> <start> He confessed himself 
 obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , 
 which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the 
 ill - consequences of Lydia 's flight , on her own folly alone . <end>   5.810117998668424
<start> <start> He 
 meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future 
 situation , he could conjecture very little about it . <end>   4.420913159386631
<start> <start> He must go 
 somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have 
 nothing to live on . <end>   7.319949663552155
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy asked him why he had not married your 
 sister at once . <end>   4.97232351354909
<start> <start> But he found , in reply to 
 this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more 
 effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . <end>   5.417926795459848
<start> <start> Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof 
 against the temptation of immediate relief . <end>   4.745027664028671
<start> <start> They met several times , 
 for there was much to be discussed . <end>   8.160008636066921
<start> <start> Wickham of course wanted more 
 than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . <end>   5.736722036138458
<start> <start> Every thing being settled between _them_ , Mr . Darcy 's next step was 
 to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in 
 Gracechurch - street the evening before I came home . <end>   4.414173749961385
<start> <start> He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could 
 so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed 
 seeing him , till after the departure of the former . <end>   5.8674062345133535
<start> <start> He did not 
 leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a 
 gentleman had called on business . <end>   6.5555493243458365
<start> <start> It was not all settled before Monday : as soon 
 as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn . <end>   4.819343906588208
<start> <start> I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real 
 defect of his character after all . <end>   5.738537882727098
<start> <start> He has been accused of many 
 faults at different times ; but _this_ is the true one . <end>   3.407659326532447
<start> <start> Nothing was 
 to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure ( and I do 
 not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your 
 uncle would most readily have settled the whole . <end>   5.993572154400824
<start> <start> They battled it 
 together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman 
 or lady concerned in it deserved . <end>   5.902090811462111
<start> <start> But at last your uncle was forced 
 to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , 
 was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , 
 which went sorely against the grain ; and I really believe your 
 letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an 
 explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give 
 the praise where it was due . <end>   5.165109073578986
<start> <start> But , Lizzy , this must go no farther 
 than yourself , or Jane at most . <end>   4.888772544310683
<start> <start> The reason why all this was to be done by him 
 alone , was such as I have given above . <end>   6.368189802326106
<start> <start> It was owing to him , to his 
 reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham 's character 
 had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been 
 received and noticed as he was . <end>   6.24522641067375
<start> <start> Perhaps there was some truth in 
 _this_ ; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve , or _anybody 's_ 
 reserve , can be answerable for the event . <end>   4.946198896802436
<start> <start> When all this was resolved 
 on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at 
 Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more 
 when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to 
 receive the last finish . <end>   6.3136803630022085
<start> <start> I believe I have now told you every thing . <end>   6.0682138129440455
<start> <start> It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I 
 hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . <end>   5.082455680746721
<start> <start> _He_ was 
 exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I 
 would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour 
 while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane 's letter 
 last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a 
 piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no 
 fresh pain . <end>   5.708363147083578
<start> <start> I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , 
 representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and 
 all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . <end>   8.078202683306433
<start> <start> If she heard me , 
 it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . <end>   7.381983012237321
<start> <start> I was 
 sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth 
 and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . <end>   5.756532252792091
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy was 
 punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the 
 wedding . <end>   7.174993957650241
<start> <start> Will you be very angry with me , my dear 
 Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never bold 
 enough to say before ) how much I like him . <end>   4.569163599726274
<start> <start> His behaviour to us has , 
 in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire . <end>   4.664421169435994
<start> <start> His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but 
 a little more liveliness , and _that_ , if he marry _prudently_ , his 
 wife may teach him . <end>   4.11170631976135
<start> <start> But slyness seems the fashion . <end>   3.5366329004828727
<start> <start> Pray forgive 
 me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so 
 far , as to exclude me from P . I shall never be quite happy till I 
 have been all round the park . <end>   4.8419794491554375
<start> <start> A low phaeton , with a nice little 
 pair of ponies , would be the very thing . <end>   4.4159376568046715
<start> <start> The children have been wanting me this half hour . <end>   3.4408989798566623
<start> <start> Your 's , very 
 sincerely , 
 
 " M . GARDINER . " 
 
 The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , 
 in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the 
 greatest share . <end>   4.036549196692908
<start> <start> The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had 
 produced of what Mr . Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister 's 
 match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too 
 great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the 
 pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! <end>   4.649807397147474
<start> <start> He had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the 
 trouble and mortification attendant on such a research ; in which 
 supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and 
 despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , 
 persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to 
 avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . <end>   5.286006896723779
<start> <start> He had 
 done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem . <end>   5.103027205126723
<start> <start> But it was a hope 
 shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her 
 vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for 
 her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a 
 sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham . <end>   5.181787297637843
<start> <start> Brother - in - law of Wickham ! <end>   6.239310696126686
<start> <start> Every kind of pride must revolt from the 
 connection . <end>   5.149683131496613
<start> <start> He had to be sure done much . <end>   6.112232223275458
<start> <start> It was reasonable that he should feel 
 he had been wrong ; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising 
 it ; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , 
 she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might 
 assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be 
 materially concerned . <end>   4.9811275923460165
<start> <start> It was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that 
 they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a 
 return . <end>   5.482549944587075
<start> <start> Oh ! <end>   7.296773763321134
<start> <start> Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get 
 the better of himself . <end>   7.296016681549503
<start> <start> She read over her aunt 's commendation of him 
 again and again . <end>   5.240688060249688
<start> <start> It was hardly enough ; but it pleased her . <end>   4.9634073334856605
<start> <start> She was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one 's 
 approach ; and before she could strike into another path , she was 
 overtaken by Wickham . <end>   5.1416989144070335
<start> <start> " I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , 
 as he joined her . <end>   4.104818941231446
<start> <start> " You certainly do , " she replied with a smile ; " but it does not follow 
 that the interruption must be unwelcome . " 
 
 " I should be sorry indeed , if it were . <end>   5.065018223060066
<start> <start> _We_ were always good friends ; 
 and now we are better . " 
 
 " True . <end>   4.836178552946126
<start> <start> Are the others coming out ? " 
 
 " I do not know . <end>   3.6281703769009845
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that 
 you have actually seen Pemberley . " 
 
 She replied in the affirmative . <end>   5.745820886446093
<start> <start> " I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much 
 for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle . <end>   8.136536630898009
<start> <start> Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of 
 me . <end>   7.7907750737904085
<start> <start> But of course she did not mention my name to you . " 
 
 " Yes , she did . " 
 
 " And what did she say ? " 
 
 " That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had - - not turned 
 out well . <end>   4.772921298068775
<start> <start> At such a distance as _that_ , you know , things are strangely 
 misrepresented . " 
 
 " Certainly , " he replied , biting his lips . <end>   3.2978970305051876
<start> <start> We passed each other 
 several times . <end>   6.956456311057997
<start> <start> I wonder what he can be doing there . " 
 
 " Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , " said 
 Elizabeth . <end>   5.003872261401285
<start> <start> " It must be something particular , to take him there at this 
 time of year . " 
 
 " Undoubtedly . <end>   5.568038107187886
<start> <start> Did you see him while you were at Lambton ? <end>   6.25363250768345
<start> <start> When I last saw her , she was not very promising . <end>   6.111863709121831
<start> <start> I am very glad 
 you liked her . <end>   5.239041314975937
<start> <start> I hope she will turn out well . " 
 
 " I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . " 
 
 " Did you go by the village of Kympton ? " 
 
 " I do not recollect that we did . " 
 
 " I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had . <end>   4.432528314715377
<start> <start> A 
 most delightful place ! - - Excellent Parsonage House ! <end>   3.8688856782600283
<start> <start> One ought not to 
 repine ; - - but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! <end>   8.026663921985037
<start> <start> But it was not to be . <end>   8.595438845848808
<start> <start> Did you ever hear Darcy mention the 
 circumstance , when you were in Kent ? " 
 
 " I _have_ heard from authority , which I thought _as good_ , that it was 
 left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . " 
 
 " You have . <end>   4.838942619999966
<start> <start> Yes , there was something in _that_ ; I told you so from the 
 first , you may remember . " 
 
 " I _did_ hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon - making was not so 
 palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually 
 declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business 
 had been compromised accordingly . " 
 
 " You did ! <end>   4.906480256981232
<start> <start> and it was not wholly without foundation . <end>   5.208823006175838
<start> <start> You may remember 
 what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . " 
 
 They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast 
 to get rid of him ; and unwilling for her sister 's sake , to provoke him , 
 she only said in reply , with a good - humoured smile , 
 
 " Come , Mr . Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . <end>   6.06505838544948
<start> <start> Do not let us 
 quarrel about the past . <end>   5.504084566802929
<start> <start> In future , I hope we shall be always of one 
 mind . " 
 
 She held out her hand ; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though 
 he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house . <end>   4.456747864590314
<start> <start> CHAPTER XI . 
 
 
 Mr . Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he 
 never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth , 
 by introducing the subject of it ; and she was pleased to find that she 
 had said enough to keep him quiet . <end>   5.490329539362181
<start> <start> " Oh ! <end>   4.2396923682408225
<start> <start> my dear Lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? " 
 
 " Oh , lord ! <end>   4.5103906770239615
<start> <start> I don 't know . <end>   5.171407701135783
<start> <start> Not these two or three years perhaps . " 
 
 " Write to me very often , my dear . " 
 
 " As often as I can . <end>   4.358667126162888
<start> <start> But you know married women have never much time for 
 writing . <end>   4.576502225019526
<start> <start> My sisters may write to _me_ . <end>   4.161403507412683
<start> <start> They will have nothing else to 
 do . " 
 
 Mr . Wickham 's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife 's . <end>   4.8968386993378346
<start> <start> He 
 smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things . <end>   4.1498691143037645
<start> <start> " He is as fine a fellow , " said Mr . Bennet , as soon as they were out of 
 the house , " as ever I saw . <end>   5.546795647591799
<start> <start> He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us 
 all . <end>   8.052051752620097
<start> <start> I defy even Sir William Lucas 
 himself , to produce a more valuable son - in - law . " 
 
 The loss of her daughter made Mrs . <end>   4.212083264958591
<start> <start> Bennet very dull for several days . <end>   3.480988247787035
<start> <start> One seems so forlorn without them . " 
 
 " This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , " said 
 Elizabeth . <end>   3.9044723706992146
<start> <start> Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; 
 but only because her husband 's regiment happens to be so far off . <end>   5.362550969363828
<start> <start> If 
 that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . " 
 
 But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was 
 shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by 
 an article of news , which then began to be in circulation . <end>   5.54547475304132
<start> <start> The 
 housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the 
 arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot 
 there for several weeks . <end>   5.423618415321706
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> " Well , well , and so Mr . Bingley is coming down , sister , " ( for Mrs . <end>   5.899263880420607
<start> <start> Philips first brought her the news . ) " Well , so much the better . <end>   3.847031770382175
<start> <start> But , however , he is very welcome to 
 come to Netherfield , if he likes it . <end>   7.020255935098855
<start> <start> And who knows what _may_ happen ? <end>   2.7845997346147784
<start> <start> But that is nothing to us . <end>   7.975434588386139
<start> <start> You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to 
 mention a word about it . <end>   5.35881097345754
<start> <start> Nicholls was in 
 Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose 
 to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . <end>   5.908818647016775
<start> <start> She was 
 going to the butcher 's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on 
 Wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be 
 killed . " 
 
 Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing 
 colour . <end>   5.434421613192753
<start> <start> But don 't imagine it was from 
 any silly cause . <end>   5.424392802123327
<start> <start> I was only confused for the moment , because I felt 
 that I _should_ be looked at . <end>   6.104486433143999
<start> <start> I do assure you , that the news does not 
 affect me either with pleasure or pain . <end>   5.192433026100066
<start> <start> I am glad of one thing , that he 
 comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . <end>   5.037394678266191
<start> <start> Not that I am afraid 
 of _myself_ , but I dread other people 's remarks . " 
 
 Elizabeth did not know what to make of it . <end>   4.791572851372311
<start> <start> Had she not seen him in 
 Derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no 
 other view than what was acknowledged ; but she still thought him partial 
 to Jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming 
 there _with_ his friend 's permission , or being bold enough to come 
 without it . <end>   5.433908016364277
<start> <start> I _will_ leave him to himself . " 
 
 In spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her 
 feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , Elizabeth could easily 
 perceive that her spirits were affected by it . <end>   7.0378518068414975
<start> <start> You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I 
 went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . <end>   6.608352554498478
<start> <start> But it ended in 
 nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool 's errand again . " 
 
 His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention 
 would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to 
 Netherfield . <end>   5.040940383316184
<start> <start> He knows where we live . <end>   3.645784440700059
<start> <start> I will not spend _my_ hours in 
 running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back 
 again . " 
 
 " Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not 
 wait on him . <end>   4.229805248813539
<start> <start> But , however , that shan 't prevent my asking him to dine 
 here , I am determined . <end>   5.043333861624781
<start> <start> We must have Mrs . <end>   7.251287138511317
<start> <start> Long and the Gouldings soon . <end>   7.455352647173822
<start> <start> As the day of his arrival drew near , 
 
 " I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said Jane to her sister . <end>   7.24237856528752
<start> <start> " It 
 would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can 
 hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . <end>   5.239586104027536
<start> <start> My mother means well ; 
 but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she 
 says . <end>   5.720846323347008
<start> <start> Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over ! " 
 
 " I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , " replied Elizabeth ; " but 
 it is wholly out of my power . <end>   5.962268966769752
<start> <start> You must feel it ; and the usual 
 satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because 
 you have always so much . " 
 
 Mr . Bingley arrived . <end>   5.649986270735442
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet , through the assistance of servants , 
 contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety 
 and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could . <end>   5.803595608517249
<start> <start> She counted 
 the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent ; 
 hopeless of seeing him before . <end>   4.236897782928622
<start> <start> But on the third morning after his 
 arrival in Hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing - room window , 
 enter the paddock , and ride towards the house . <end>   5.974548226587015
<start> <start> Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy . <end>   3.3089383038250575
<start> <start> Mr . what 's his name . <end>   4.675143705177278
<start> <start> That tall , proud man . " 
 
 " Good gracious ! <end>   3.6256150760980246
<start> <start> She knew but little 
 of their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness 
 which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time 
 after receiving his explanatory letter . <end>   5.626791233402482
<start> <start> Both sisters were uncomfortable 
 enough . <end>   5.788876524252692
<start> <start> Each felt for the other , and of course for themselves ; and their 
 mother talked on , of her dislike of Mr . Darcy , and her resolution to be 
 civil to him only as Mr . Bingley 's friend , without being heard by either 
 of them . <end>   6.449359242441895
<start> <start> But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be 
 suspected by Jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs . <end>   4.445444802954737
<start> <start> Gardiner 's letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . <end>   5.208745634890711
<start> <start> To Jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and 
 whose merit she had undervalued ; but to her own more extensive 
 information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted 
 for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an 
 interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as 
 what Jane felt for Bingley . <end>   6.096468555451542
<start> <start> Her astonishment at his coming - - at his 
 coming to Netherfield , to Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , 
 was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered 
 behaviour in Derbyshire . <end>   5.7533956899416445
<start> <start> The colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a 
 minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to 
 her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and 
 wishes must still be unshaken . <end>   5.189585496322264
<start> <start> But she would not be secure . <end>   7.151223302851614
<start> <start> " Let me first see how he behaves , " said she ; " it will then be early 
 enough for expectation . " 
 
 She sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to 
 lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her 
 sister , as the servant was approaching the door . <end>   4.547951470421457
<start> <start> Jane looked a little 
 paler than usual , but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected . <end>   4.230511855542969
<start> <start> On the 
 gentlemen 's appearing , her colour increased ; yet she received them with 
 tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any 
 symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . <end>   4.088665256271633
<start> <start> Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down 
 again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . <end>   5.522415644252304
<start> <start> She 
 had ventured only one glance at Darcy . <end>   4.171616497311415
<start> <start> But , perhaps he could not in her mother 's 
 presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt . <end>   5.421401016409486
<start> <start> It was a painful , but 
 not an improbable , conjecture . <end>   5.385017360118592
<start> <start> Bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period 
 saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed . <end>   4.974391318494037
<start> <start> Elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the 
 preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was 
 hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill 
 applied . <end>   4.343795329687269
<start> <start> Darcy , after enquiring of her how Mr . and Mrs . <end>   7.4443386266967915
<start> <start> Gardiner did , a question 
 which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing . <end>   5.682086159987796
<start> <start> He was not seated by her ; perhaps that was the reason of his silence ; 
 but it had not been so in Derbyshire . <end>   6.63977279103078
<start> <start> There he had talked to her 
 friends , when he could not to herself . <end>   11.67730263950378
<start> <start> But now several minutes elapsed , 
 without bringing the sound of his voice ; and when occasionally , unable 
 to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she 
 as often found him looking at Jane , as at herself , and frequently on no 
 object but the ground . <end>   5.304584296931619
<start> <start> She was disappointed , 
 and angry with herself for being so . <end>   4.336730717144771
<start> <start> " Yet why did he come ? " 
 
 She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself ; and to 
 him she had hardly courage to speak . <end>   4.9566582436689375
<start> <start> " It is a long time , Mr . Bingley , since you went away , " said Mrs . <end>   4.9376475357957235
<start> <start> Bennet . <end>   10.318399796512947
<start> <start> " I began to be afraid you would never come back again . <end>   8.228989536592643
<start> <start> People _did_ say , 
 you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope 
 it is not true . <end>   6.3833898392057025
<start> <start> Miss Lucas is married and settled . <end>   4.1385997548424305
<start> <start> And one of my 
 own daughters . <end>   7.952935031287395
<start> <start> I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have 
 seen it in the papers . <end>   10.411624218862732
<start> <start> It was only said , 'Lately , 
 George Wickham , Esq . <end>   7.257069478173572
<start> <start> to Miss Lydia Bennet , 'without there being a 
 syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . <end>   7.422360583808477
<start> <start> It was my brother Gardiner 's drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to 
 make such an awkward business of it . <end>   5.635883925527386
<start> <start> Did you see it ? " 
 
 Bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . <end>   7.026930639695574
<start> <start> Elizabeth 
 dared not lift up her eyes . <end>   4.038073805768513
<start> <start> They are gone down to 
 Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to 
 stay , I do not know how long . <end>   6.262424722309697
<start> <start> His regiment is there ; for I suppose you 
 have heard of his leaving the - - - - shire , and of his being gone into the 
 regulars . <end>   7.507073874804918
<start> <start> he has _some_ friends , though perhaps not so 
 many as he deserves . " 
 
 Elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at Mr . Darcy , was in such misery 
 of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat . <end>   6.145573460211977
<start> <start> A few weeks , he believed . <end>   7.9444015855625425
<start> <start> I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and 
 will save all the best of the covies for you . " 
 
 Elizabeth 's misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious 
 attention ! <end>   4.805870880809156
<start> <start> Were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had 
 flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be 
 hastening to the same vexatious conclusion . <end>   5.151819417149565
<start> <start> At that instant she felt , 
 that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends , for 
 moments of such painful confusion . <end>   4.600473407826247
<start> <start> Their society can afford no pleasure , 
 that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! <end>   5.170722621059655
<start> <start> Let me never see either 
 one or the other again ! " 
 
 Yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no 
 compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing 
 how much the beauty of her sister re - kindled the admiration of her 
 former lover . <end>   4.417150951729303
<start> <start> When first he came in , he had spoken to her but little ; 
 but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . <end>   6.315859329064435
<start> <start> He 
 found her as handsome as she had been last year ; as good natured , and as 
 unaffected , though not quite so chatty . <end>   5.074703723253213
<start> <start> Jane was anxious that no 
 difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded 
 that she talked as much as ever . <end>   5.5293959502163315
<start> <start> But her mind was so busily engaged , 
 that she did not always know when she was silent . <end>   6.821787398934599
<start> <start> When the gentlemen rose to go away , Mrs . <end>   4.398949493483643
<start> <start> " You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr . Bingley , " she added , " for when 
 you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with 
 us , as soon as you returned . <end>   5.372950952874508
<start> <start> I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure 
 you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep 
 your engagement . " 
 
 Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of 
 his concern , at having been prevented by business . <end>   5.659234267514752
<start> <start> They then went away . <end>   4.9672092834209725
<start> <start> Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine 
 there , that day ; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did 
 not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a 
 man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and 
 pride of one who had ten thousand a - year . <end>   5.0737827641646955
<start> <start> CHAPTER XII . 
 
 
 As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits ; 
 or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that 
 must deaden them more . <end>   4.3923913222844595
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy 's behaviour astonished and vexed her . <end>   3.579002104880755
<start> <start> " Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , 
 " did he come at all ? " 
 
 She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . <end>   6.263443288903955
<start> <start> " He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when 
 he was in town ; and why not to me ? <end>   8.152546146979303
<start> <start> If he fears me , why come hither ? <end>   4.431004555303327
<start> <start> Teazing , teazing , man ! <end>   3.8721833296642254
<start> <start> I will 
 think no more about him . " 
 
 Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach 
 of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her 
 better satisfied with their visitors , than Elizabeth . <end>   5.098802812661639
<start> <start> " Now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly 
 easy . <end>   4.266517408760408
<start> <start> I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by 
 his coming . <end>   7.809548987543216
<start> <start> I am glad he dines here on Tuesday . <end>   3.2950753909235693
<start> <start> It will then be publicly 
 seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent 
 acquaintance . " 
 
 " Yes , very indifferent indeed , " said Elizabeth , laughingly . <end>   3.492000491123686
<start> <start> " Oh , Jane , 
 take care . " 
 
 " My dear Lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now . " 
 
 " I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with 
 you as ever . "

 They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday ; and Mrs . <end>   5.087106268098785
<start> <start> Bennet , in 
 the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good 
 humour , and common politeness of Bingley , in half an hour 's visit , had 
 revived . <end>   5.612093643970927
<start> <start> On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn ; and the two , 
 who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as 
 sportsmen , were in very good time . <end>   5.209867454333641
<start> <start> When they repaired to the 
 dining - room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take 
 the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by 
 her sister . <end>   6.083889288583658
<start> <start> Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to 
 invite him to sit by herself . <end>   5.346008408729711
<start> <start> On entering the room , he seemed to 
 hesitate ; but Jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was 
 decided . <end>   6.948856545193905
<start> <start> He 
 bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that 
 Bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes 
 likewise turned towards Mr . Darcy , with an expression of half - laughing 
 alarm . <end>   4.268737394610721
<start> <start> His behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an 
 admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded 
 Elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , Jane 's happiness , and his 
 own , would be speedily secured . <end>   6.024681202595345
<start> <start> Though she dared not depend upon the 
 consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . <end>   6.148784397078019
<start> <start> It 
 gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast ; for she was in 
 no cheerful humour . <end>   6.079254768787751
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy was almost as far from her , as the table 
 could divide them . <end>   6.916118497590815
<start> <start> She knew how little 
 such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to 
 advantage . <end>   6.112357149483088
<start> <start> She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but 
 she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and 
 cold was their manner , whenever they did . <end>   5.3114174207280085
<start> <start> Her mother 's ungraciousness , 
 made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth 's mind ; 
 and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell 
 him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of 
 the family . <end>   5.49407110577611
<start> <start> Anxious and 
 uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing - room , before the 
 gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her 
 uncivil . <end>   6.963885464476491
<start> <start> She looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all 
 her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . <end>   6.7751641920243255
<start> <start> " If he does not come to me , _then_ , " said she , " I shall give him up for 
 ever . " 
 
 The gentlemen came ; and she thought he looked as if he would have 
 answered her hopes ; but , alas ! <end>   5.431891912151892
<start> <start> And on the gentlemen 's approaching , one of 
 the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , 
 
 " The men shan 't come and part us , I am determined . <end>   5.495491917266842
<start> <start> We want none of them ; 
 do we ? " 
 
 Darcy had walked away to another part of the room . <end>   5.71116942686715
<start> <start> She followed him with 
 her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience 
 enough to help anybody to coffee ; and then was enraged against herself 
 for being so silly ! <end>   4.304897930500404
<start> <start> " A man who has once been refused ! <end>   3.247712567050121
<start> <start> How could I ever be foolish enough to 
 expect a renewal of his love ? <end>   6.053953477005317
<start> <start> Is there one among the sex , who would not 
 protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? <end>   5.561859562107247
<start> <start> Have all her friends left her ? " 
 
 " Mrs . <end>   5.417515386930099
<start> <start> Annesley is with her . <end>   5.889756144053801
<start> <start> The others have been gone on to Scarborough , 
 these three weeks . " 
 
 She could think of nothing more to say ; but if he wished to converse 
 with her , he might have better success . <end>   6.087696551761007
<start> <start> He stood by her , however , for 
 some minutes , in silence ; and , at last , on the young lady 's whispering 
 to Elizabeth again , he walked away . <end>   9.817211756897017
<start> <start> When the tea - things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies 
 all rose , and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when 
 all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her 
 mother 's rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated 
 with the rest of the party . <end>   4.988472262072673
<start> <start> She now lost every expectation of pleasure . <end>   4.66281755183092
<start> <start> They were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had 
 nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side 
 of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself . <end>   5.916686436086164
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to 
 supper ; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the 
 others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . <end>   4.5283763685339276
<start> <start> The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . <end>   4.063548559975249
<start> <start> The 
 venison was roasted to a turn - - and everybody said , they never saw so fat 
 a haunch . <end>   4.218296459136682
<start> <start> The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the 
 Lucas 's last week ; and even Mr . Darcy acknowledged , that the partridges 
 were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three French 
 cooks at least . <end>   4.8032429997594255
<start> <start> And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater 
 beauty . <end>   4.508038514553338
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . <end>   4.906276235349372
<start> <start> And 
 what do you think she said besides ? <end>   6.978760789775534
<start> <start> 'Ah ! <end>   21.420661255697155
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet , we shall have her 
 at Netherfield at last . 'She did indeed . <end>   6.75444961729094
<start> <start> I do think Mrs . <end>   4.927631981006278
<start> <start> Long is as good 
 a creature as ever lived - - and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , 
 and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously . " 
 
 Mrs . <end>   4.363084007000461
<start> <start> " It has been a very agreeable day , " said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth . <end>   8.85317084798011
<start> <start> " The 
 party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . <end>   5.49298128376228
<start> <start> You must not suspect me . <end>   4.670864637101916
<start> <start> It mortifies me . <end>   6.763698077029099
<start> <start> I 
 assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an 
 agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it . <end>   3.8782901422183045
<start> <start> It is only that he is blessed with 
 greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally 
 pleasing than any other man . " 
 
 " You are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and 
 are provoking me to it every moment . " 
 
 " How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! " 
 
 " And how impossible in others ! " 
 
 " But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I 
 acknowledge ? " 
 
 " That is a question which I hardly know how to answer . <end>   4.48507492636098
<start> <start> We all love to 
 instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . <end>   4.8588154951822915
<start> <start> His 
 friend had left him that morning for London , but was to return home in 
 ten days time . <end>   5.44213512992485
<start> <start> He sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably 
 good spirits . <end>   4.850888894467894
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> He came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them 
 dressed . <end>   7.256302200934905
<start> <start> In ran Mrs . <end>   5.665815024591938
<start> <start> He is come - - Mr . Bingley is 
 come . - - He is , indeed . <end>   8.37716732378526
<start> <start> Make haste , make haste . <end>   6.183952796719698
<start> <start> Here , Sarah , come to Miss 
 Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . <end>   5.28718891936341
<start> <start> hang Kitty ! <end>   9.956911683913217
<start> <start> what has she to do with it ? <end>   11.941330825241316
<start> <start> where is your sash my dear ? " 
 
 But when her mother was gone , Jane would not be prevailed on to go down 
 without one of her sisters . <end>   5.592307587691372
<start> <start> After tea , Mr . Bennet retired to the library , as was his 
 custom , and Mary went up stairs to her instrument . <end>   6.351060872825368
<start> <start> Two obstacles of the 
 five being thus removed , Mrs . <end>   4.310799423036472
<start> <start> Elizabeth would not observe her ; and when at last 
 Kitty did , she very innocently said , " What is the matter mamma ? <end>   7.0368891767062465
<start> <start> What do 
 you keep winking at me for ? <end>   4.951938025248189
<start> <start> What am I to do ? " 
 
 " Nothing child , nothing . <end>   4.391779850029934
<start> <start> I did not wink at you . " She then sat still five 
 minutes longer ; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she 
 suddenly got up , and saying to Kitty , 
 
 " Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , " took her out of the room . <end>   5.881325598356246
<start> <start> Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth , which spoke her distress at 
 such premeditation , and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it . <end>   6.066676668160765
<start> <start> Bennet half opened the door and called out , 
 
 " Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . " 
 
 Elizabeth was forced to go . <end>   5.264498623100057
<start> <start> " Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in 
 my dressing - room . " 
 
 Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained 
 quietly in the hall , till she and Kitty were out of sight , then returned 
 into the drawing - room . <end>   4.879864044826766
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet 's schemes for this day were ineffectual . <end>   4.031301960472683
<start> <start> His 
 ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their 
 evening party ; and he bore with the ill - judged officiousness of the 
 mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command 
 of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter . <end>   4.911108487633376
<start> <start> He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper ; and before he went 
 away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and Mrs . <end>   3.6963915723906946
<start> <start> Bennet 's means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . <end>   6.651198255006233
<start> <start> After this day , Jane said no more of her indifference . <end>   6.764674338197829
<start> <start> Seriously , however , she felt tolerably 
 persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman 's 
 concurrence . <end>   5.3100133020125835
<start> <start> Bingley was punctual to his appointment ; and he and Mr . Bennet spent the 
 morning together , as had been agreed on . <end>   7.020258698565475
<start> <start> The latter was much more 
 agreeable than his companion expected . <end>   5.50991142207489
<start> <start> There was nothing of presumption 
 or folly in Bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him 
 into silence ; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the 
 other had ever seen him . <end>   5.360448726414034
<start> <start> Bingley of course returned with him to dinner ; 
 and in the evening Mrs . <end>   8.540600269114321
<start> <start> Bennet 's invention was again at work to get 
 every body away from him and her daughter . <end>   5.162125114556012
<start> <start> Elizabeth , who had a letter 
 to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea ; 
 for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be 
 wanted to counteract her mother 's schemes . <end>   5.470341996633185
<start> <start> But on returning to the drawing - room , when her letter was finished , she 
 saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother 
 had been too ingenious for her . <end>   5.486555026951526
<start> <start> On opening the door , she perceived her 
 sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in 
 earnest conversation ; and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of 
 both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would 
 have told it all . <end>   4.829254950747911
<start> <start> _Their_ situation was awkward enough ; but _her 's_ she 
 thought was still worse . <end>   4.055251187530187
<start> <start> Not a syllable was uttered by either ; and 
 Elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when Bingley , who as 
 well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few 
 words to her sister , ran out of the room . <end>   5.081639228006513
<start> <start> Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth , where confidence would give 
 pleasure ; and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest 
 emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . <end>   5.729605412489998
<start> <start> I do not deserve it . <end>   5.022905065529934
<start> <start> Oh ! <end>   7.296773763321134
<start> <start> But she would not 
 allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be 
 said , for the present . <end>   5.650280402652206
<start> <start> " I would not on any 
 account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it 
 from any one but myself . <end>   5.898002928151969
<start> <start> He is gone to my father already . <end>   6.476650722442612
<start> <start> Oh ! <end>   7.296773763321134
<start> <start> Lizzy , to 
 know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear 
 family ! <end>   6.762552201596504
<start> <start> how shall I bear so much happiness ! " 
 
 She then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the 
 card party , and was sitting up stairs with Kitty . <end>   4.716437334446286
<start> <start> " And this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend 's anxious 
 circumspection ! <end>   5.327088805549599
<start> <start> of all his sister 's falsehood and contrivance ! <end>   7.93592412478224
<start> <start> " With my mother up stairs . <end>   5.090626904816209
<start> <start> She will be down in a moment I dare say . " 
 
 He then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and 
 affection of a sister . <end>   5.852797054572016
<start> <start> They shook hands with 
 great cordiality ; and then till her sister came down , she had to listen 
 to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of Jane 's perfections ; 
 and in spite of his being a lover , Elizabeth really believed all his 
 expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for 
 basis the excellent understanding , and super - excellent disposition of 
 Jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and 
 himself . <end>   5.715237140997115
<start> <start> It was an evening of no common delight to them all ; the satisfaction of 
 Miss Bennet 's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as 
 made her look handsomer than ever . <end>   4.461303804962015
<start> <start> Kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped 
 her turn was coming soon . <end>   5.182380406496604
<start> <start> Not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their 
 visitor took his leave for the night ; but as soon as he was gone , he 
 turned to his daughter and said , 
 
 " Jane , I congratulate you . <end>   5.8753228784908025
<start> <start> You will be a very happy woman . " 
 
 Jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his 
 goodness . <end>   6.52625102733193
<start> <start> " You are a good girl ; " he replied , " and I have great pleasure in 
 thinking you will be so happily settled . <end>   5.557758862994918
<start> <start> I have not a doubt of your 
 doing very well together . <end>   4.692652433138354
<start> <start> Your tempers are by no means unlike . <end>   3.628173758976679
<start> <start> You are 
 each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so 
 easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will 
 always exceed your income . " 
 
 " I hope not so . <end>   5.071601536040496
<start> <start> Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be 
 unpardonable in _me_ . " 
 
 " Exceed their income ! <end>   3.4576558901429295
<start> <start> My dear Mr . Bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you 
 talking of ? <end>   6.29022415487358
<start> <start> Why , he has four or five thousand a - year , and very likely 
 more . " Then addressing her daughter , " Oh ! <end>   6.376188734248204
<start> <start> my dear , dear Jane , I am so 
 happy ! <end>   7.12116626572795
<start> <start> I am sure I sha 'nt get a wink of sleep all night . <end>   2.1228123236391747
<start> <start> I knew how it 
 would be . <end>   6.721162899901867
<start> <start> I always said it must be so , at last . <end>   6.2061771462448725
<start> <start> I was sure you could not 
 be so beautiful for nothing ! <end>   6.495221410908661
<start> <start> I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when 
 he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was 
 that you should come together . <end>   6.159008194695899
<start> <start> Jane was beyond competition her 
 favourite child . <end>   4.936830339049715
<start> <start> At that moment , she cared for no other . <end>   7.472847965641843
<start> <start> Her younger 
 sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness 
 which she might in future be able to dispense . <end>   4.7907205828414945
<start> <start> Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield ; and Kitty 
 begged very hard for a few balls there every winter . <end>   5.368174251288101
<start> <start> Bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn ; 
 coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after 
 supper ; unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough 
 detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought 
 himself obliged to accept . <end>   4.975513388832457
<start> <start> In the absence of Jane , 
 he always attached himself to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of 
 her ; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly sought the same means of 
 relief . <end>   6.657158521607455
<start> <start> " He has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me , that 
 he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! <end>   5.686294342259054
<start> <start> I had not 
 believed it possible . " 
 
 " I suspected as much , " replied Elizabeth . <end>   5.570828436076536
<start> <start> " But how did he account for 
 it ? " 
 
 " It must have been his sister 's doing . <end>   5.686272942311362
<start> <start> They were certainly no friends to

 chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . <end>   5.269519081637152
<start> <start> Good girl ! <end>   8.997673425112167
<start> <start> It would vex me , indeed , to see you again 
 the dupe of Miss Bingley 's pretended regard . " 
 
 " Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , 
 he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being 
 indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " 
 
 " He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his 
 modesty . " 
 
 This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence , and 
 the little value he put on his own good qualities . <end>   5.453062854133972
<start> <start> Elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference 
 of his friend , for , though Jane had the most generous and forgiving 
 heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice 
 her against him . <end>   6.257974049538225
<start> <start> " I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! " cried 
 Jane . <end>   3.751035840522409
<start> <start> " Oh ! <end>   4.2396923682408225
<start> <start> If I could but see _you_ as happy ! <end>   5.365200138639985
<start> <start> If there _were_ but 
 such another man for you ! " 
 
 " If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as 
 you . <end>   5.321422030921586
<start> <start> Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your 
 happiness . <end>   7.076060143972698
<start> <start> No , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very 
 good luck , I may meet with another Mr . Collins in time . " 
 
 The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a 
 secret . <end>   4.9750840917222305
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs . <end>   3.977836078798887
<start> <start> Philips , and 
 _she_ ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her 
 neighbours in Meryton . <end>   6.481795540509658
<start> <start> The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the 
 world , though only a few weeks before , when Lydia had first run away , 
 they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune . <end>   5.825518430764569
<start> <start> It was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the 
 equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . <end>   7.1949874822223405
<start> <start> It was lady Catherine de Bourgh . <end>   4.152971874971099
<start> <start> Bennet and Kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even 
 inferior to what Elizabeth felt . <end>   5.9971491211255135
<start> <start> She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no 
 other reply to Elizabeth 's salutation , than a slight inclination of the 
 head , and sat down without saying a word . <end>   5.29837110495811
<start> <start> Elizabeth had mentioned her 
 name to her mother , on her ladyship 's entrance , though no request of 
 introduction had been made . <end>   7.005361394107543
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> After sitting 
 for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to Elizabeth , 
 
 " I hope you are well , Miss Bennet . <end>   5.729528790577162
<start> <start> That lady I suppose is your mother . " 
 
 Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was . <end>   5.229073401591687
<start> <start> " And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters . " 
 
 " Yes , madam , " said Mrs . <end>   3.978501479808049
<start> <start> Bennet , delighted to speak to a lady Catherine . <end>   6.306425184715777
<start> <start> " She is my youngest girl but one . <end>   4.549913432479643
<start> <start> My youngest of all , is lately married , 
 and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , 
 who I believe will soon become a part of the family . " 
 
 " You have a very small park here , " returned Lady Catherine after a short 
 silence . <end>   5.19042086761754
<start> <start> " It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I 
 assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas 's . " 
 
 " This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in 
 summer ; the windows are full west . " 
 
 Mrs . <end>   4.553138412703167
<start> <start> Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner ; and then 
 added , 
 
 " May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr . and 
 Mrs . <end>   4.124818698920355
<start> <start> Collins well . " 
 
 " Yes , very well . <end>   4.5165736094396935
<start> <start> But no 
 letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled . <end>   6.271958979917798
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some 
 refreshment ; but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , 
 declined eating any thing ; and then rising up , said to Elizabeth , 
 
 " Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness 
 on one side of your lawn . <end>   6.517218560462317
<start> <start> I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you 
 will favour me with your company . " 
 
 " Go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the 
 different walks . <end>   5.412541367390844
<start> <start> I think she will be pleased with the hermitage . " 
 
 Elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , 
 attended her noble guest down stairs . <end>   6.13677544648973
<start> <start> As they passed through the hall , 
 Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining - parlour and 
 drawing - room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent 
 looking rooms , walked on . <end>   4.852342372897958
<start> <start> Her carriage remained at the door , and Elizabeth saw that her 
 waiting - woman was in it . <end>   5.101976870388464
<start> <start> They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk 
 that led to the copse ; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for 
 conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and 
 disagreeable . <end>   5.932895604851726
<start> <start> " How could I ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in 
 her face . <end>   5.500548293757646
<start> <start> As soon as they entered the copse , Lady Catherine began in the following 
 manner : - - 
 
 " You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my 
 journey hither . <end>   5.267980170142899
<start> <start> Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I 
 come . " 
 
 Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . <end>   4.149031647809835
<start> <start> " Indeed , you are mistaken , Madam . <end>   6.707702463718001
<start> <start> I have not been at all able to account 
 for the honour of seeing you here . " 
 
 " Miss Bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to 
 know , that I am not to be trifled with . <end>   5.6358272477720766
<start> <start> But however insincere _you_ may 
 choose to be , you shall not find _me_ so . <end>   4.4211129515651715
<start> <start> My character has ever been 
 celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such 
 moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it . <end>   4.3271288783451025
<start> <start> A report of a most 
 alarming nature , reached me two days ago . <end>   3.27895764287627
<start> <start> I was told , that not only your 
 sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that 
 _you_ , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon 
 afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Mr . Darcy . <end>   6.352136792447836
<start> <start> What could your ladyship propose by it ? " 
 
 " At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted . " 
 
 " Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , " said Elizabeth , 
 coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report 
 is in existence . " 
 
 " If ! <end>   4.701145136810423
<start> <start> do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? <end>   10.69298005779806
<start> <start> Has it not been 
 industriously circulated by yourselves ? <end>   3.9672213111711883
<start> <start> _You_ 
 may ask questions , which _I_ shall not choose to answer . " 
 
 " This is not to be borne . <end>   5.037679775105895
<start> <start> Has 
 he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " 
 
 " Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . " 
 
 " It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his 
 reason . <end>   4.73839643974712
<start> <start> But _your_ arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , 
 have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . <end>   5.9720948779396235
<start> <start> You 
 may have drawn him in . " 
 
 " If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . " 
 
 " Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ? <end>   6.344363921147847
<start> <start> I have not been accustomed to such 
 language as this . <end>   4.3557310616415394
<start> <start> This match , to which you have the 
 presumption to aspire , can never take place . <end>   5.962417471696793
<start> <start> No , never . <end>   7.611336793847294
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy is 
 engaged to _my daughter_ . <end>   4.690156962338338
<start> <start> Now what have you to say ? " 
 
 " Only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will 
 make an offer to me . " 
 
 Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , 
 
 " The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . <end>   6.168665579233235
<start> <start> From their infancy , 
 they have been intended for each other . <end>   6.057841564097314
<start> <start> It was the favourite wish of 
 _his_ mother , as well as of her 's . <end>   8.419900221291673
<start> <start> While in their cradles , we planned 
 the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would 
 be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of 
 inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to 
 the family ! <end>   6.044937368964729
<start> <start> Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? <end>   7.33796877590505
<start> <start> To his 
 tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh ? <end>   4.911811178138538
<start> <start> Are you lost to every feeling of 
 propriety and delicacy ? <end>   5.0907256093373245
<start> <start> But what is that to me ? <end>   8.186583434685948
<start> <start> You both did as much as you could , in planning the 
 marriage . <end>   7.685647210995064
<start> <start> Its completion depended on others . <end>   3.36991003543647
<start> <start> If Mr . Darcy is neither by 
 honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make 
 another choice ? <end>   4.584911678183161
<start> <start> And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? " 
 
 " Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it . <end>   3.379031951315937
<start> <start> Yes , Miss 
 Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or 
 friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . <end>   7.418451021014671
<start> <start> You will 
 be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him . <end>   5.166930490163993
<start> <start> Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned 
 by any of us . " 
 
 " These are heavy misfortunes , " replied Elizabeth . <end>   3.864179437428597
<start> <start> " But the wife of Mr . 
 Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily 
 attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause 
 to repine . " 
 
 " Obstinate , headstrong girl ! <end>   4.769905334115846
<start> <start> I am ashamed of you ! <end>   10.084686356898525

 for my attentions to you last spring ? <end>   6.2437321917430495

 score ? <end>   7.43430463358048

 with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be 
 dissuaded from it . <end>   3.8737210272982363
<start> <start> I have not been used to submit to any person 's whims . <end>   3.705531942687321
<start> <start> I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment . " 
 
 " _That_ will make your ladyship 's situation at present more pitiable ; 
 but it will have no effect on _me_ . " 
 
 " I will not be interrupted . <end>   3.762699672513378

 nephew are formed for each other . <end>   4.142325696577994

 sides is splendid . <end>   3.1188135793019596

 were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , 
 in which you have been brought up . " 
 
 " In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that 
 sphere . <end>   5.548791735571205

 equal . "

 condition . " 
 
 " Whatever my connections may be , " said Elizabeth , " if your nephew does 
 not object to them , they can be nothing to _you_ . " 
 
 " Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? " 
 
 Though Elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging Lady 
 Catherine , have answered this question ; she could not but say , after a 
 moment 's deliberation , 
 
 " I am not . " 
 
 Lady Catherine seemed pleased . <end>   4.682552084033865
<start> <start> " And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? " 
 
 " I will make no promise of the kind . " 
 
 " Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished . <end>   4.639698363655997

 reasonable young woman . <end>   7.2358221541719905
<start> <start> But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I 
 will ever recede . <end>   6.296171221659205

 assurance I require . " 
 
 " And I certainly _never_ shall give it . <end>   4.127479546069358
<start> <start> I am not to be intimidated into 
 anything so wholly unreasonable . <end>   4.203928334307718
<start> <start> Your ladyship wants Mr . Darcy to marry 
 your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise , make 
 _their_ marriage at all more probable ? <end>   3.903100377344339
<start> <start> Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with 
 which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as 
 frivolous as the application was ill - judged . <end>   5.693383448907121
<start> <start> You have widely mistaken my 
 character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these . <end>   5.267015327686868

 I cannot tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in 
 mine . <end>   4.534268944806346
<start> <start> I must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the 
 subject . " 
 
 " Not so hasty , if you please . <end>   4.760383773515611
<start> <start> I have by no means done . <end>   5.782016305223999
<start> <start> To all the 
 objections I have already urged , I have still another to add . <end>   5.585646004296297

 stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister 's infamous 
 elopement . <end>   5.4607662243367825

 patched - up business , at the expence of your father and uncles . <end>   6.2015256632798375

<start> <start> Heaven and earth ! - - of what 
 are you thinking ? <end>   5.982641157640767
<start> <start> Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ? " 
 
 " You can _now_ have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered . <end>   3.8565427204487457
<start> <start> " You have insulted me , in every possible method . <end>   6.279380631226816
<start> <start> I must beg to return to 
 the house . " 
 
 And she rose as she spoke . <end>   5.745550399535898
<start> <start> Lady Catherine rose also , and they turned 
 back . <end>   5.892703594354505

<start> <start> " You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! <end>   7.122468603552497
<start> <start> Do you not consider that a connection with you , 
 must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? " 
 
 " Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say . <end>   5.590103912319569
<start> <start> You know my sentiments . " 
 
 " You are then resolved to have him ? " 
 
 " I have said no such thing . <end>   3.9382596659214615
<start> <start> I am only resolved to act in that manner , 
 which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without 
 reference to _you_ , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . " 
 
 " It is well . <end>   4.706673466365701
<start> <start> You refuse , then , to oblige me . <end>   6.250185330012277
<start> <start> You refuse to obey the 
 claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . <end>   5.374779999824193
<start> <start> You are determined to ruin him in 
 the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . " 
 
 " Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied Elizabeth , " have any 
 possible claim on me , in the present instance . <end>   5.6844684235513565
<start> <start> No principle of either , 
 would be violated by my marriage with Mr . Darcy . <end>   5.025867389402525
<start> <start> And with regard to the 
 resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former 
 _were_ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment 's 
 concern - - and the world in general would have too much sense to join in 
 the scorn . " 
 
 " And this is your real opinion ! <end>   5.495993758154875
<start> <start> This is your final resolve ! <end>   5.5931359430471
<start> <start> Very well . <end>   9.813896634472243
<start> <start> Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your 
 ambition will ever be gratified . <end>   4.573449370820101
<start> <start> I came to try you . <end>   6.381304076182783
<start> <start> I hoped to find you 
 reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . " 
 
 In this manner Lady Catherine talked on , till they were at the door of 
 the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , 
 
 " I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . <end>   6.110697977300819
<start> <start> I send no compliments to your 
 mother . <end>   6.020423533088391
<start> <start> You deserve no such attention . <end>   4.923832618476291
<start> <start> I am most seriously displeased . " 
 
 Elizabeth made no answer ; and without attempting to persuade her 
 ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself . <end>   4.0674421628014805
<start> <start> She 
 heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs . <end>   3.610588925833187
<start> <start> Her mother 
 impatiently met her at the door of the dressing - room , to ask why Lady 
 Catherine would not come in again and rest herself . <end>   5.10246370890963
<start> <start> and her calling here was prodigiously 
 civil ! <end>   4.022031124752149
<start> <start> for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well . <end>   6.4316245640025915
<start> <start> She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through 
 Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . <end>   5.904794052304553
<start> <start> Lady Catherine it 
 appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings , 
 for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr . 
 Darcy . <end>   4.595813926116007
<start> <start> She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her 
 sister must bring them more frequently together . <end>   3.5777711645833072
<start> <start> In revolving lady Catherine 's expressions , however , she could not help 
 feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting 
 in this interference . <end>   4.739544122891195
<start> <start> From what she had said of her resolution to 
 prevent their marriage , it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate 
 an application to her nephew ; and how _he_ might take a similar 
 representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared 
 not pronounce . <end>   6.664202960791198
<start> <start> She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his 
 aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose 
 that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do ; and it 
 was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ , 
 whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would 
 address him on his weakest side . <end>   5.247947442023649
<start> <start> If he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often 
 seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might 
 settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity 
 unblemished could make him . <end>   6.101913806451822
<start> <start> In that case he would return no more . <end>   4.3603644790289815
<start> <start> Lady 
 Catherine might see him in her way through town ; and his engagement to 
 Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way . <end>   5.790788429030431
<start> <start> I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of 
 his constancy . <end>   4.395933061967516
<start> <start> If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might 
 have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him 
 at all . " 
 
 * * * * * 
 
 The surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had 
 been , was very great ; but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same 
 kind of supposition , which had appeased Mrs . <end>   4.832678276194044
<start> <start> Bennet 's curiosity ; and 
 Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject . <end>   4.184003099313747
<start> <start> The next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her 
 father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand . <end>   7.515002473810766
<start> <start> It suddenly struck her that it might 
 be from lady Catherine ; and she anticipated with dismay all the 
 consequent explanations . <end>   5.891392146355738
<start> <start> He 
 then said , 
 
 " I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me 
 exceedingly . <end>   4.032639422300323
<start> <start> As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its 
 contents . <end>   5.230903391113846
<start> <start> I did not know before , that I had _two_ daughters on the brink 
 of matrimony . <end>   6.206404604930922
<start> <start> Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . " 
 
 The colour now rushed into Elizabeth 's cheeks in the instantaneous 
 conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt ; 
 and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained 
 himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to 
 herself ; when her father continued , 
 
 " You look conscious . <end>   5.365975993759316
<start> <start> Young ladies have great penetration in such matters 
 as these ; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity , to discover the 
 name of your admirer . <end>   4.869624722042186
<start> <start> and what can _he_ have to say ? " 
 
 " Something very much to the purpose of course . <end>   5.7339969796861325
<start> <start> He begins with 
 congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of 
 which it seems he has been told , by some of the good - natured , gossiping 
 Lucases . <end>   6.395571553512002
<start> <start> I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says 
 on that point . <end>   4.091100092398347
<start> <start> What relates to yourself , is as follows . <end>   6.1620414830076635
<start> <start> " Having thus 
 offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs . <end>   2.436013360800745
<start> <start> Collins and myself on 
 this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : 
 of which we have been advertised by the same authority . <end>   5.3596187030826705
<start> <start> Your daughter 
 Elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after 
 her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , 
 may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious 
 personages in this land . " 
 
 " Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? " " This young 
 gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of 
 mortal can most desire , - - splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive 
 patronage . <end>   4.881183578455227
<start> <start> Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin 
 Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate 
 closure with this gentleman 's proposals , which , of course , you will be 
 inclined to take immediate advantage of . " 
 
 " Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? <end>   5.2264768384237605
<start> <start> But now it comes out . " 
 
 " My motive for cautioning you , is as follows . <end>   3.5685810663774946
<start> <start> We have reason to imagine 
 that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with 
 a friendly eye . " 
 
 " _Mr . Darcy_ , you see , is the man ! <end>   5.156883413130639
<start> <start> Now , Lizzy , I think I _have_ 
 surprised you . <end>   4.985089673079089
<start> <start> Could he , or the Lucases , have pitched on any man , within 
 the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more 
 effectually to what they related ? <end>   4.769723034929217
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy , who never looks at any 
 woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at _you_ in 
 his life ! <end>   4.9709526702516955
<start> <start> It is admirable ! " 
 
 Elizabeth tried to join in her father 's pleasantry , but could only force 
 one most reluctant smile . <end>   4.367451979058702
<start> <start> Never had his wit been directed in a manner so 
 little agreeable to her . <end>   3.945375552581986
<start> <start> " Are you not diverted ? " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   3.640503590763745
<start> <start> yes . <end>   17.783510400420354
<start> <start> Pray read on . " 
 
 " After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last 
 night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she 
 felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some 
 family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her 
 consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match . <end>   5.241289516162722
<start> <start> I thought it my duty 
 to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and 
 her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run 
 hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . " " Mr . 
 Collins moreover adds , " " I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia 's sad 
 business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their 
 living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally 
 known . <end>   5.256832971575277
<start> <start> I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain 
 from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young 
 couple into your house as soon as they were married . <end>   3.92723053784207
<start> <start> It was an 
 encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should 
 very strenuously have opposed it . <end>   4.536897796643003
<start> <start> You ought certainly to forgive them as 
 a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names 
 to be mentioned in your hearing . " " _That_ is his notion of christian 
 forgiveness ! <end>   4.36965768437867
<start> <start> The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte 's 
 situation , and his expectation of a young olive - branch . <end>   5.341911423476578
<start> <start> For what do we 
 live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our 
 turn ? " 
 
 " Oh ! " cried Elizabeth , " I am excessively diverted . <end>   4.952539775011089
<start> <start> But it is so 
 strange ! " 
 
 " Yes - - _that_ is what makes it amusing . <end>   4.5156485833175255
<start> <start> Had they fixed on any other man 
 it would have been nothing ; but _his_ perfect indifference , and _your_ 
 pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! <end>   4.646605390665049
<start> <start> Much as I abominate 
 writing , I would not give up Mr . Collins 's correspondence for any 
 consideration . <end>   5.187923255696494
<start> <start> Nay , when I read a letter of his , I cannot help giving 
 him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and 
 hypocrisy of my son - in - law . <end>   5.587086369388312
<start> <start> And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine 
 about this report ? <end>   5.883682101854499
<start> <start> Did she call to refuse her consent ? " 
 
 To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh ; and as it had 
 been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his 
 repeating it . <end>   4.197486927667466
<start> <start> Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her 
 feelings appear what they were not . <end>   6.0156174043009365
<start> <start> It was necessary to laugh , when she 
 would rather have cried . <end>   4.754692108693095
<start> <start> Her father had most cruelly mortified her , by 
 what he said of Mr . Darcy 's indifference , and she could do nothing but 
 wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of 
 his seeing too _little_ , she might have fancied too _much_ . <end>   5.037868074872961
<start> <start> CHAPTER XVI . 
 
 
 Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as 
 Elizabeth half expected Mr . Bingley to do , he was able to bring Darcy 
 with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine 's 
 visit . <end>   5.60617092254953
<start> <start> The gentlemen arrived early ; and , before Mrs . <end>   5.14651431163748
<start> <start> It was agreed to . <end>   5.944084736970629
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Bennet was not in the 
 habit of walking , Mary could never spare time , but the remaining five 
 set off together . <end>   4.482428203741991
<start> <start> Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to 
 outstrip them . <end>   7.001739074709429
<start> <start> They lagged behind , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy , 
 were to entertain each other . <end>   9.537284347902942
<start> <start> Very little was said by either ; Kitty was 
 too much afraid of him to talk ; Elizabeth was secretly forming a 
 desperate resolution ; and perhaps he might be doing the same . <end>   5.2065894514066065
<start> <start> They walked towards the Lucases , because Kitty wished to call upon 
 Maria ; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , 
 when Kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone . <end>   4.424617691611666
<start> <start> Now was the 
 moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was 
 high , she immediately said , 
 
 " Mr . Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving 
 relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your 's . <end>   5.667794866245214
<start> <start> I 
 can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor 
 sister . <end>   3.7557060307497068
<start> <start> Ever since I have known it , I have been most anxious to 
 acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . <end>   6.506617245481602
<start> <start> I did not think Mrs . <end>   6.800065158087185
<start> <start> Lydia 's thoughtlessness first betrayed to 
 me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could 
 not rest till I knew the particulars . <end>   7.892287204661986
<start> <start> Let me thank you again and again , 
 in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced 
 you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the 
 sake of discovering them . " 
 
 " If you _will_ thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone . <end>   5.18815401634242
<start> <start> That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other 
 inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . <end>   5.618649930890814
<start> <start> But your 
 _family_ owe me nothing . <end>   4.101844544707391
<start> <start> Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought 
 only of _you_ . " 
 
 Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word . <end>   6.406031995843295
<start> <start> After a short pause , 
 her companion added , " You are too generous to trifle with me . <end>   6.261592020438635
<start> <start> If your 
 feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once . <end>   4.00942304925428
<start> <start> _My_ 
 affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence 
 me on this subject for ever . " 
 
 Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of 
 his situation , now forced herself to speak ; and immediately , though not 
 very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone 
 so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make 
 her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances . <end>   4.511615711278187
<start> <start> The 
 happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never 
 felt before ; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as 
 warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . <end>   4.787275573501589
<start> <start> Had Elizabeth 
 been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the 
 expression of heart - felt delight , diffused over his face , became him ; 
 but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of 
 feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his 
 affection every moment more valuable . <end>   5.845570596905174
<start> <start> They walked on , without knowing in what direction . <end>   5.344271242874824
<start> <start> There was too much to 
 be thought ; and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . <end>   9.287386992536709
<start> <start> She 
 soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding 
 to the efforts of his aunt , who _did_ call on him in her return through 
 London , and there relate her journey to Longbourn , its motive , and the 
 substance of her conversation with Elizabeth ; dwelling emphatically on 
 every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship 's apprehension , 
 peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that 
 such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from 
 her nephew , which _she_ had refused to give . <end>   5.24819970833113
<start> <start> But , unluckily for her 
 ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise . <end>   4.431439986569497
<start> <start> " It taught me to hope , " said he , " as I had scarcely ever allowed myself 
 to hope before . <end>   5.752069124196766
<start> <start> After abusing you so 
 abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all 
 your relations . " 
 
 " What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ? <end>   5.813538141362745
<start> <start> It was 
 unpardonable . <end>   7.214745648560146
<start> <start> I cannot think of it without abhorrence . " 
 
 " We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that 
 evening , " said Elizabeth . <end>   5.408453183174612
<start> <start> " The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , 
 will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved 
 in civility . " 
 
 " I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself . <end>   5.04947073575939
<start> <start> The recollection of what I 
 then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of 
 it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me . <end>   8.398575925010398
<start> <start> Your 
 reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : 'had you behaved in a 
 more gentleman - like manner .' Those were your words . <end>   2.974976331697857
<start> <start> I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such 
 a way . " 
 
 " I can easily believe it . <end>   4.906896521200558
<start> <start> The turn of your countenance I shall never 
 forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible 
 way , that would induce you to accept me . " 
 
 " Oh ! <end>   5.190274308945463
<start> <start> do not repeat what I then said . <end>   8.520351977672885
<start> <start> These recollections will not do at 
 all . <end>   6.805511037672448
<start> <start> I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . " 
 
 Darcy mentioned his letter . <end>   5.539650675048367
<start> <start> " Did it , " said he , " did it _soon_ make you 
 think better of me ? <end>   6.040620347322816
<start> <start> Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its 
 contents ? " 
 
 She explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her 
 former prejudices had been removed . <end>   4.79825575522864
<start> <start> " I knew , " said he , " that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was 
 necessary . <end>   5.8123538266718064
<start> <start> I hope you have destroyed the letter . <end>   6.597776364305159
<start> <start> There was one part 
 especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the 
 power of reading again . <end>   5.495279981340256
<start> <start> I can remember some expressions which might 
 justly make you hate me . " 
 
 " The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the 
 preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my 
 opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily 
 changed as that implies . " 
 
 " When I wrote that letter , " replied Darcy , " I believed myself perfectly 
 calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a 
 dreadful bitterness of spirit . " 
 
 " The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . <end>   3.8990500399635444
<start> <start> The 
 adieu is charity itself . <end>   2.6133091767561605
<start> <start> The feelings 
 of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so 
 widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant 
 circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten . <end>   6.0197986541763635
<start> <start> Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you 
 pleasure . " 
 
 " I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . <end>   4.59769318255693
<start> <start> _Your_ 
 retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment 
 arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of 
 ignorance . <end>   5.76623144612177
<start> <start> But with _me_ , it is not so . <end>   5.881674471307691
<start> <start> Painful recollections will 
 intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled . <end>   6.604589543989201
<start> <start> I have been a 
 selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . <end>   6.012184660036837
<start> <start> As a 
 child I was taught what was _right_ , but I was not taught to correct my 
 temper . <end>   5.503481317019361
<start> <start> I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride 
 and conceit . <end>   5.308629034117371
<start> <start> Unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only _child_ ) 
 I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father 
 particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , 
 almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond 
 my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to 
 _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with 
 my own . <end>   4.4472891026207035
<start> <start> Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might 
 still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth ! <end>   6.013430922576266
<start> <start> What do I not 
 owe you ! <end>   5.091243045543119
<start> <start> You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most 
 advantageous . <end>   4.117802626371341
<start> <start> By you , I was properly humbled . <end>   7.76453167902373
<start> <start> I came to you without a 
 doubt of my reception . <end>   8.179947277156908
<start> <start> You shewed me how insufficient were all my 
 pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . " 
 
 " Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? " 
 
 " Indeed I had . <end>   4.286444750162465
<start> <start> What will you think of my vanity ? <end>   6.132897502770777
<start> <start> I believed you to be 
 wishing , expecting my addresses . " 
 
 " My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you . <end>   4.01606470877865
<start> <start> I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . <end>   3.688462440912501
<start> <start> I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take 
 a proper direction . " 
 
 " I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at 
 Pemberley . <end>   4.150861629565201
<start> <start> You blamed me for coming ? " 
 
 " No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . " 
 
 " Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you . <end>   3.495930008790343
<start> <start> My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I 
 confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due . " 
 
 " My object _then_ , " replied Darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility 
 in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped 
 to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you 
 see that your reproofs had been attended to . <end>   5.12697281553258
<start> <start> How soon any other wishes 
 introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an 
 hour after I had seen you . " 
 
 He then told her of Georgiana 's delight in her acquaintance , and of her 
 disappointment at its sudden interruption ; which naturally leading to 
 the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of 
 following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed 
 before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness 
 there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must 
 comprehend . <end>   4.358376110646405
<start> <start> After walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know 
 any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that 
 it was time to be at home . <end>   5.764624973216075
<start> <start> " What could become of Mr . Bingley and Jane ! " was a wonder which 
 introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs . <end>   4.174173141044727
<start> <start> Darcy was delighted with 
 their engagement ; his friend had given him the earliest information of 
 it . <end>   7.309196783500266
<start> <start> " I must ask whether you were surprised ? " said Elizabeth . <end>   4.446184829448638
<start> <start> " Not at all . <end>   5.304129895844975
<start> <start> When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . " 
 
 " That is to say , you had given your permission . <end>   6.302897646495886
<start> <start> I guessed as much . " And 
 though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much 
 the case . <end>   9.867658398647338
<start> <start> " On the evening before my going to London , " said he " I made a confession 
 to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . <end>   6.354675090120298
<start> <start> I told him of 
 all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , 
 absurd and impertinent . <end>   5.7444649149259766
<start> <start> His surprise was great . <end>   4.587668869773345
<start> <start> He had never had the 
 slightest suspicion . <end>   7.674989461161351
<start> <start> I told him , moreover , that I believed myself 
 mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent 
 to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was 
 unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . " 
 
 Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his 
 friend . <end>   6.3460030387496165
<start> <start> " Did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him 
 that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? " 
 
 " From the former . <end>   4.755007778327745
<start> <start> I had narrowly observed her during the two visits 
 which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . " 
 
 " And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to 
 him . " 
 
 " It did . <end>   5.131433592863625
<start> <start> Bingley is most unaffectedly modest . <end>   4.654029857171622
<start> <start> His diffidence had 
 prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but 
 his reliance on mine , made every thing easy . <end>   4.5303680354773705
<start> <start> I was obliged to confess 
 one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . <end>   5.944364728461774
<start> <start> But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained 
 in any doubt of your sister 's sentiments . <end>   5.480846509917532
<start> <start> He has heartily forgiven me 
 now . " 
 
 Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr . Bingley had been a most delightful 
 friend ; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable ; but she checked 
 herself . <end>   4.141336373331978
<start> <start> She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it 
 was rather too early to begin . <end>   5.586686861404794
<start> <start> In anticipating the happiness of Bingley , 
 which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the 
 conversation till they reached the house . <end>   6.994896721378485
<start> <start> CHAPTER XVII . 
 
 
 " My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question 
 which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room , and 
 from all the others when they sat down to table . <end>   5.781618096514864
<start> <start> She had only to say in 
 reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own 
 knowledge . <end>   6.131352488186985
<start> <start> She coloured as she spoke ; but neither that , nor any thing 
 else , awakened a suspicion of the truth . <end>   4.887703984331855
<start> <start> The evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary . <end>   4.3228238997647965
<start> <start> The 
 acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent . <end>   2.6255147837965076
<start> <start> Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth ; 
 and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather _knew_ that she was happy , 
 than _felt_ herself to be so ; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , 
 there were other evils before her . <end>   4.919483552683188
<start> <start> At night she opened her heart to Jane . <end>   4.229833343804801
<start> <start> " You are joking , Lizzy . <end>   4.676619413054281
<start> <start> This cannot be ! - - engaged to Mr . Darcy ! <end>   6.704897493859929
<start> <start> No , no , 
 you shall not deceive me . <end>   7.612878089771104
<start> <start> I know it to be impossible . " 
 
 " This is a wretched beginning indeed ! <end>   4.814989272542661
<start> <start> My sole dependence was on you ; and 
 I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . <end>   5.074768255090019
<start> <start> I speak nothing but the truth . <end>   9.084053068201106
<start> <start> " Oh , Lizzy ! <end>   7.492425477023353
<start> <start> it cannot be . <end>   10.77835068346407
<start> <start> I know how much 
 you dislike him . " 
 
 " You know nothing of the matter . <end>   6.901098276036939
<start> <start> _That_ is all to be forgot . <end>   13.050079399991162
<start> <start> Perhaps I 
 did not always love him so well as I do now . <end>   7.537308831532422
<start> <start> But in such cases as these , 
 a good memory is unpardonable . <end>   6.47382397113546
<start> <start> This is the last time I shall ever 
 remember it myself . " 
 
 Miss Bennet still looked all amazement . <end>   4.57044505648908
<start> <start> " Good Heaven ! <end>   5.188106109520608
<start> <start> can it be really so ! <end>   5.943544553569911
<start> <start> Yet now I must believe you , " cried 
 Jane . <end>   5.862562569194349
<start> <start> forgive the question - - are you quite certain that you can be 
 happy with him ? " 
 
 " There can be no doubt of that . <end>   6.747376271163394
<start> <start> It is settled between us already , that 
 we are to be the happiest couple in the world . <end>   5.769357317954915
<start> <start> But are you pleased , 
 Jane ? <end>   11.298550153347584
<start> <start> Shall you like to have such a brother ? " 
 
 " Very , very much . <end>   6.51254637952969
<start> <start> Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more 
 delight . <end>   3.189603144159059
<start> <start> But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . <end>   7.758631453402949
<start> <start> And do you 
 really love him quite well enough ? <end>   5.9542059381776795
<start> <start> Oh , Lizzy ! <end>   10.426123429159613
<start> <start> do any thing rather than 
 marry without affection . <end>   5.59865292768682
<start> <start> Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought 
 to do ? " 
 
 " Oh , yes ! <end>   4.967951406719197
<start> <start> I am 
 afraid you will be angry . " 
 
 " My dearest sister , now _be_ be serious . <end>   3.7038547157160213
<start> <start> I want to talk very seriously . <end>   5.577501731428454
<start> <start> Will you tell 
 me how long you have loved him ? " 
 
 " It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began . <end>   4.258285261166293
<start> <start> But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds 
 at Pemberley . " 
 
 Another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the 
 desired effect ; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of 
 attachment . <end>   4.8021260661794285
<start> <start> When convinced on that article , Miss Bennet had nothing 
 farther to wish . <end>   5.780367939057132
<start> <start> " Now I am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself . <end>   6.22070153734932
<start> <start> Were it for nothing but his love of you , I 
 must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley 's friend and your 
 husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . <end>   5.616937829339275
<start> <start> How little did you 
 tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! <end>   5.905535249294188
<start> <start> I owe all that I know 
 of it , to another , not to you . " 
 
 Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy . <end>   9.179302052399112
<start> <start> She had been unwilling to 
 mention Bingley ; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made 
 her equally avoid the name of his friend . <end>   6.073244311274616
<start> <start> But now she would no longer 
 conceal from her , his share in Lydia 's marriage . <end>   5.121268862784477
<start> <start> * * * * * 
 
 " Good gracious ! " cried Mrs . <end>   3.5887641769539083
<start> <start> Bennet , as she stood at a window the next 
 morning , " if that disagreeable Mr . Darcy is not coming here again with 
 our dear Bingley ! <end>   4.399227928058994
<start> <start> What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always 
 coming here ? <end>   5.215593019802065
<start> <start> I had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or 
 other , and not disturb us with his company . <end>   4.6383661759496615
<start> <start> What shall we do with him ? <end>   8.982879892478833
<start> <start> Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley 's 
 way . " 
 
 Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal ; yet 
 was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an 
 epithet . <end>   4.976732608011782
<start> <start> As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively , and 
 shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information ; 
 and he soon afterwards said aloud , " Mr . Bennet , have you no more lanes 
 hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? " 
 
 " I advise Mr . Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , " said Mrs . <end>   5.312212935592302
<start> <start> Wont it , Kitty ? " 
 
 Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . <end>   6.331971150491182
<start> <start> Darcy professed a great 
 curiosity to see the view from the Mount , and Elizabeth silently 
 consented . <end>   5.033057563587481
<start> <start> As she went up stairs to get ready , Mrs . <end>   4.484842354565387
<start> <start> Bennet followed her , 
 saying , 
 
 " I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that 
 disagreeable man all to yourself . <end>   6.606341601080049
<start> <start> So , do not put yourself to 
 inconvenience . " 
 
 During their walk , it was resolved that Mr . Bennet 's consent should be 
 asked in the course of the evening . <end>   6.062797532204659
<start> <start> She could not determine how her mother 
 would take it ; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur 
 would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man . <end>   4.52322372758287
<start> <start> But whether she 
 were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it 
 was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to 
 her sense ; and she could no more bear that Mr . Darcy should hear the 
 first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her 
 disapprobation . <end>   6.236010368456254
<start> <start> * * * * * 
 
 In the evening , soon after Mr . Bennet withdrew to the library , she saw 
 Mr . Darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was 
 extreme . <end>   5.119853688548478
<start> <start> She did not fear her father 's opposition , but he was going to 
 be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that _she_ , 
 his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be 
 filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched 
 reflection , and she sat in misery till Mr . Darcy appeared again , when , 
 looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . <end>   6.173812457499614
<start> <start> In a few minutes 
 he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty ; and , while 
 pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " Go to your father , he 
 wants you in the library . " She was gone directly . <end>   6.489143645080967
<start> <start> Her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious . <end>   4.1469572811133695
<start> <start> Are you out of your senses , to be 
 accepting this man ? <end>   6.717667482887229
<start> <start> Have not you always hated him ? " 
 
 How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more 
 reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! <end>   3.9670222560302433
<start> <start> It would have spared her from 
 explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give ; 
 but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of 
 her attachment to Mr . Darcy . <end>   5.387642057727274
<start> <start> " Or in other words , you are determined to have him . <end>   6.209573460901312
<start> <start> But will they make you happy ? " 
 
 " Have you any other objection , " said Elizabeth , " than your belief of my 
 indifference ? " 
 
 " None at all . <end>   3.6804146072379935
<start> <start> We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but 
 this would be nothing if you really liked him . " 
 
 " I do , I do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " I love him . <end>   5.884556174525135
<start> <start> Indeed he has no improper pride . <end>   6.933720682090299
<start> <start> He is perfectly amiable . <end>   4.806858012132526
<start> <start> He is the kind 
 of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he 
 condescended to ask . <end>   6.936605312995526
<start> <start> I now give it to _you_ , if you are resolved on 
 having him . <end>   7.546509968156885
<start> <start> But let me advise you to think better of it . <end>   6.351242371052367
<start> <start> I know your 
 disposition , Lizzy . <end>   7.780510562565353
<start> <start> I know that you could be neither happy nor 
 respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked 
 up to him as a superior . <end>   4.127393454005027
<start> <start> Your lively talents would place you in the 
 greatest danger in an unequal marriage . <end>   3.030652564976882
<start> <start> You could scarcely escape 
 discredit and misery . <end>   2.699258872825277
<start> <start> My child , let me not have the grief of seeing 
 _you_ unable to respect your partner in life . <end>   3.5119796018193683
<start> <start> You know not what you are 
 about . " 
 
 Elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply ; 
 and at length , by repeated assurances that Mr . Darcy was really the 
 object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her 
 estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that 
 his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many 
 months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she 
 did conquer her father 's incredulity , and reconcile him to the match . <end>   5.182749625804775
<start> <start> " Well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " I have no more to 
 say . <end>   5.548971122750509
<start> <start> If this be the case , he deserves you . <end>   5.936363638426493
<start> <start> I could not have parted with 
 you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy . " 
 
 To complete the favourable impression , she then told him what Mr . Darcy 
 had voluntarily done for Lydia . <end>   5.136779829823043
<start> <start> He heard her with astonishment . <end>   4.361312173721096
<start> <start> " This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! <end>   4.763678589807993
<start> <start> And so , Darcy did every thing ; 
 made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow 's debts , and got him 
 his commission ! <end>   5.482628075771727
<start> <start> So much the better . <end>   4.749796384484161
<start> <start> It will save me a world of trouble 
 and economy . <end>   4.498704893543142
<start> <start> Had it been your uncle 's doing , I must and _would_ have 
 paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own 
 way . <end>   4.266181452772013
<start> <start> I shall offer to pay him to - morrow ; he will rant and storm about 
 his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . " 
 
 He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading 
 Mr . Collins 's letter ; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her 
 at last to go - - saying , as she quitted the room , " If any young men come 
 for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . " 
 
 Elizabeth 's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight ; and , after 
 half an hour 's quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join 
 the others with tolerable composure . <end>   5.508915428181078
<start> <start> Every thing was too recent for 
 gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away ; there was no longer any 
 thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity 
 would come in time . <end>   4.326599218347543
<start> <start> When her mother went up to her dressing - room at night , she followed her , 
 and made the important communication . <end>   5.908443067083623
<start> <start> Bennet sat quite still , and 
 unable to utter a syllable . <end>   4.788685876715095
<start> <start> Nor was it under many , many minutes , that 
 she could comprehend what she heard ; though not in general backward to 
 credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the 
 shape of a lover to any of them . <end>   5.90448230905105
<start> <start> She began at length to recover , to 
 fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless 
 herself . <end>   4.682043000893883
<start> <start> " Good gracious ! <end>   4.6802708237681285
<start> <start> Lord bless me ! <end>   5.583181482065666
<start> <start> dear me ! <end>   8.582270152048933
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy ! <end>   5.318499263005845
<start> <start> Who would 
 have thought it ! <end>   7.7674388790257725
<start> <start> And is it really true ? <end>   6.9690857547950165
<start> <start> Oh ! <end>   7.296773763321134
<start> <start> my sweetest Lizzy ! <end>   6.072641831700836
<start> <start> how rich 
 and how great you will be ! <end>   5.7887755691929605
<start> <start> What pin - money , what jewels , what carriages 
 you will have ! <end>   5.751023837276522
<start> <start> I am so 
 pleased - - so happy . <end>   6.359008390850994
<start> <start> Such a charming man ! - - so handsome ! <end>   4.977517805903894
<start> <start> so tall ! - - Oh , my 
 dear Lizzy ! <end>   7.855188038575253
<start> <start> pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before . <end>   4.710861875320318
<start> <start> I 
 hope he will overlook it . <end>   4.559483539776491
<start> <start> Dear , dear Lizzy . <end>   9.579396824876905
<start> <start> Every thing 
 that is charming ! <end>   9.746520189747637
<start> <start> Ten thousand a year ! <end>   8.077058494016832
<start> <start> Oh , 
 Lord ! <end>   16.884346856624553
<start> <start> What will become of me . <end>   5.496009139029769
<start> <start> I shall go distracted . " 
 
 This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and 
 Elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , 
 soon went away . <end>   5.020525100951104
<start> <start> 'Tis as good as a Lord ! <end>   6.47701124907744
<start> <start> And a 
 special licence . <end>   7.084493079945034
<start> <start> You must and shall be married by a special licence . <end>   5.005528854792297
<start> <start> But 
 my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr . Darcy is particularly fond of , 
 that I may have it to - morrow . " 
 
 This was a sad omen of what her mother 's behaviour to the gentleman 
 himself might be ; and Elizabeth found , that though in the certain 
 possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations '
 consent , there was still something to be wished for . <end>   6.554562107238949
<start> <start> But the morrow 
 passed off much better than she expected ; for Mrs . <end>   4.073893633560528
<start> <start> Bennet luckily stood 
 in such awe of her intended son - in - law , that she ventured not to speak 
 to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark 
 her deference for his opinion . <end>   5.43535194564421
<start> <start> Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get 
 acquainted with him ; and Mr . Bennet soon assured her that he was rising 
 every hour in his esteem . <end>   5.000073408926984
<start> <start> " I admire all my three sons - in - law highly , " said he . <end>   3.2872521991003105
<start> <start> " Wickham , perhaps , 
 is my favourite ; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well 
 as Jane 's . " 
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER XVIII . 
 
 
 Elizabeth 's spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted Mr . 
 Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . <end>   5.137976096722833
<start> <start> " How could 
 you begin ? " said she . <end>   7.03963280192413
<start> <start> " I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when 
 you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first 
 place ? " 
 
 " I cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which 
 laid the foundation . <end>   4.737475656205458
<start> <start> It is too long ago . <end>   6.1716051678921655
<start> <start> I was in the middle before I 
 knew that I _had_ begun . " 
 
 " My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners - - my behaviour 
 to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke 
 to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . <end>   5.3248223090662234
<start> <start> Now be sincere ; 
 did you admire me for my impertinence ? " 
 
 " For the liveliness of your mind , I did . " 
 
 " You may as well call it impertinence at once . <end>   4.346662410761053
<start> <start> It was very little less . <end>   5.78092966478532
<start> <start> The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious 
 attention . <end>   5.2373546036875025
<start> <start> You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking 
 and looking , and thinking for _your_ approbation alone . <end>   4.948501195791424
<start> <start> I roused , and 
 interested you , because I was so unlike _them_ . <end>   7.519885993847816
<start> <start> Had you not been really 
 amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you 
 took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and 
 in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously 
 courted you . <end>   4.632850484343694
<start> <start> To be sure , you knew no actual good of me - - but nobody thinks 
 of _that_ when they fall in love . " 
 
 " Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was 
 ill at Netherfield ? " 
 
 " Dearest Jane ! <end>   4.511898867848736
<start> <start> who could have done less for her ? <end>   12.109397967498403
<start> <start> But make a virtue of it 
 by all means . <end>   7.975017336475938
<start> <start> What made you so shy of me , when you first 
 called , and afterwards dined here ? <end>   5.374102121582348
<start> <start> Why , especially , when you called , did 
 you look as if you did not care about me ? " 
 
 " Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . " 
 
 " But I was embarrassed . " 
 
 " And so was I . " 
 
 " You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . " 
 
 " A man who had felt less , might . " 
 
 " How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that 
 I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! <end>   5.082963021889494
<start> <start> But I wonder how long you 
 _would_ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . <end>   6.261373555822693
<start> <start> I wonder when 
 you _would_ have spoken , if I had not asked you ! <end>   4.6314589481232415
<start> <start> My resolution of 
 thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . <end>   4.285378442145092
<start> <start> _Too 
 much_ , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort 
 springs from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the 
 subject ? <end>   4.947888201341124
<start> <start> This will never do . " 
 
 " You need not distress yourself . <end>   4.450156039171703
<start> <start> The moral will be perfectly fair . <end>   5.489833232098071
<start> <start> Lady 
 Catherine 's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of 
 removing all my doubts . <end>   4.338076730613314
<start> <start> I am not indebted for my present happiness to 
 your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . <end>   3.865367103131086
<start> <start> I was not in a humour to 
 wait for any opening of your 's . <end>   7.099831378920476
<start> <start> But tell me , what did you come down to 
 Netherfield for ? <end>   7.123340599524695
<start> <start> or had you intended any more serious consequence ? " 
 
 " My real purpose was to see _you_ , and to judge , if I could , whether I 
 might ever hope to make you love me . <end>   5.216267920323926
<start> <start> My avowed one , or what I avowed to 
 myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , 
 and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . " 
 
 " Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to 
 befall her ? " 
 
 " I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . <end>   4.939273648463054
<start> <start> But it ought to 
 be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done 
 directly . " 
 
 " And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and 
 admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . <end>   6.513886605089392
<start> <start> You must write again very 
 soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . <end>   5.620731937471286
<start> <start> I 
 thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes . <end>   6.948955597943635
<start> <start> Your idea of the ponies is delightful . <end>   6.653962812134201
<start> <start> We will go round the Park every day . <end>   3.768912688783509
<start> <start> I am the happiest creature in 
 the world . <end>   5.640987712971967
<start> <start> Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one 
 with such justice . <end>   6.554344915835075
<start> <start> I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I 
 laugh . <end>   4.986742684709725
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can 
 spare from me . <end>   6.393374372756685
<start> <start> Your 's , & c . " 
 
 Mr . Darcy 's letter to Lady Catherine , was in a different style ; and 
 still different from either , was what Mr . Bennet sent to Mr . Collins , in 
 reply to his last . <end>   5.387371125371488
<start> <start> " DEAR SIR , 
 
 " I must trouble you once more for congratulations . <end>   3.78337683490154
<start> <start> Elizabeth will 
 soon be the wife of Mr . Darcy . <end>   6.471486329660796
<start> <start> But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew . <end>   6.899150019875369
<start> <start> " Your 's sincerely , & c . " 
 
 Miss Bingley 's congratulations to her brother , on his approaching 
 marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere . <end>   4.5888769123611866
<start> <start> She wrote even 
 to Jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her 
 former professions of regard . <end>   6.49392608798123
<start> <start> Jane was not deceived , but she was 
 affected ; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing 
 her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved . <end>   4.9205450883713535
<start> <start> Four sides of paper were 
 insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of 
 being loved by her sister . <end>   5.195931012014936
<start> <start> Before any answer could arrive from Mr . Collins , or any congratulations 
 to Elizabeth , from his wife , the Longbourn family heard that the 
 Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge . <end>   4.932359989831958
<start> <start> Lady Catherine had been rendered so 
 exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew 's letter , that 
 Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till 
 the storm was blown over . <end>   5.840576777825297
<start> <start> He bore it however with admirable calmness . <end>   3.69244963422165
<start> <start> He could even 
 listen to Sir William Lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away 
 the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all 
 meeting frequently at St . James 's , with very decent composure . <end>   4.07321305194437
<start> <start> If he did 
 shrug his shoulders , it was not till Sir William was out of sight . <end>   4.246667347906685
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Philips 's vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his 
 forbearance ; and though Mrs . <end>   4.234191715426326
<start> <start> Philips , as well as her sister , stood in 
 too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley 's good 
 humour encouraged , yet , whenever she _did_ speak , she must be vulgar . <end>   5.2665837739596935
<start> <start> Nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all 
 likely to make her more elegant . <end>   6.408327604428332
<start> <start> Elizabeth did all she could , to shield 
 him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him 
 to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse 
 without mortification ; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising 
 from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it 
 added to the hope of the future ; and she looked forward with delight to 
 the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to 
 either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at 
 Pemberley . <end>   5.710763338399531
<start> <start> Bennet got 
 rid of her two most deserving daughters . <end>   4.247668465394141
<start> <start> With what delighted pride she 
 afterwards visited Mrs . <end>   3.9093999865355435
<start> <start> Bingley and talked of Mrs . <end>   7.677570190784217
<start> <start> Darcy may be guessed . <end>   8.892744909947591
<start> <start> I wish I could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment 
 of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , 
 produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , 
 well - informed woman for the rest of her life ; though perhaps it was 
 lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in 
 so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and 
 invariably silly . <end>   5.453679966489771
<start> <start> Mr . Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly ; his affection for her 
 drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do . <end>   3.4186735005207103
<start> <start> So near 
 a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to 
 _his_ easy temper , or _her_ affectionate heart . <end>   4.989698484110297
<start> <start> Kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with 
 her two elder sisters . <end>   6.680426277904956
<start> <start> In society so superior to what she had generally 
 known , her improvement was great . <end>   4.471291124021681
<start> <start> She was not of so ungovernable a 
 temper as Lydia , and , removed from the influence of Lydia 's example , she 
 became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less 
 ignorant , and less insipid . <end>   4.797200592614665
<start> <start> From the farther disadvantage of Lydia 's 
 society she was of course carefully kept , and though Mrs . <end>   4.748037132525053
<start> <start> Wickham 
 frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of 
 balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going . <end>   6.739878496490644
<start> <start> Mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but 
 she could still moralize over every morning visit ; and as she was no 
 longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters 'beauty and her own , 
 it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without 
 much reluctance . <end>   5.696362997196855
<start> <start> As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from 
 the marriage of her sisters . <end>   4.302592334823359
<start> <start> He bore with philosophy the conviction that 
 Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude 
 and falsehood had before been unknown to her ; and in spite of every 
 thing , was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on 
 to make his fortune . <end>   5.1410728723942265
<start> <start> The letter was to this 
 effect : 
 
 " MY DEAR LIZZY , 
 
 " I wish you joy . <end>   4.4076319468076
<start> <start> It is a great comfort to have you 
 so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will 
 think of us . <end>   7.5634124734292145
<start> <start> I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very 
 much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live 
 upon without some help . <end>   4.3467989348364675
<start> <start> Any place would do , of about three or four 
 hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr . Darcy about it , 
 if you had rather not . <end>   6.836958991314794
<start> <start> " Yours , & c . " 
 
 As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not , she endeavoured in 
 her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind . <end>   4.030965862504607
<start> <start> Such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice 
 of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she 
 frequently sent them . <end>   6.085650079329567
<start> <start> They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap 
 situation , and always spending more than they ought . <end>   3.978633407514037
<start> <start> His affection for 
 her soon sunk into indifference ; her 's lasted a little longer ; and in 
 spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to 
 reputation which her marriage had given her . <end>   5.508583674307228
<start> <start> Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley , yet , for 
 Elizabeth 's sake , he assisted him farther in his profession . <end>   5.018082583109938
<start> <start> Lydia was 
 occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself 
 in London or Bath ; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently 
 staid so long , that even Bingley 's good humour was overcome , and he 
 proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone . <end>   5.455851450400935
<start> <start> Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy 's marriage ; but as she 
 thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley , she 
 dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of Georgiana , almost as 
 attentive to Darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility 
 to Elizabeth . <end>   3.641861625299004
<start> <start> Pemberley was now Georgiana 's home ; and the attachment of the sisters 
 was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see . <end>   7.6718431869081405
<start> <start> Georgiana had the highest opinion 
 in the world of Elizabeth ; though at first she often listened with an 
 astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of 
 talking to her brother . <end>   5.479669322699064
<start> <start> He , who had always inspired in herself a respect 
 which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open 
 pleasantry . <end>   3.830900659031177
<start> <start> Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in 
 her way . <end>   4.935242421248575
<start> <start> Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; 
 and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in 
 her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him 
 language so very abusive , especially of Elizabeth , that for some time 
 all intercourse was at an end . <end>   5.669276801533189
<start> <start> But at length , by Elizabeth 's persuasion , 
 he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; 
 and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her 
 resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity 
 to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on 
 them at Pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had 
 received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the 
 visits of her uncle and aunt from the city . <end>   5.799087273394047
<start> <start> With the Gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms . <end>   5.622451323340148
<start> <start> Darcy , 
 as well as Elizabeth , really loved them ; and they were both ever 
 sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing 
 her into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them . <end>   6.176788747133782
