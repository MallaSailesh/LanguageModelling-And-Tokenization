 together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off . <end>   230.8148864372691

 civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn ; and

 without the ceremony of a formal invitation . <end>   491.3823690731134

 Sir . - - You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching 
 converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . " 
 
 The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy ; but Sir 
 William 's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his 
 eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and 
 Jane , who were dancing together . <end>   533.2424910755276

 longer , and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . <end>   368.43651044695264

 over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . <end>   1274.9699230733759

 conversation was thereby at an end , Elizabeth soon afterwards left the 
 room . <end>   708.2441360780819

 while he was present , Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else ; 
 but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those 
 hours of separation that must sometimes occur . <end>   515.9155632909852
<start> <start> In 
 confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary 
 transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming 
 her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on . <end>   669.1667592941784
<start> <start> I never heard of her existence till the day before 
 yesterday . " 
 
 " Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is 
 believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . "

 Bingley . <end>   204.3668528790026

 table for him . " 
 
 Consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her 
 husband 's incivility ; though it was very mortifying to know that her 
 neighbours might all see Mr . Bingley in consequence of it , before _they_ 
 did . <end>   394.92920748379305

 should _now_ escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of 
 influencing his felicity ; sensible that if such an idea had been 
 suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight 
 in confirming or crushing it . <end>   1135.9132369817662
<start> <start> My excellent father 
 died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr . Wickham was to 
 the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it 
 to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his 
 profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a 
 valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became 
 vacant . <end>   614.1842196359571

 Elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , 
 perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written 
 quite through , in a very close hand . - - The envelope itself was likewise 
 full . - - Pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it . <end>   669.612186035307

<start> <start> I need not explain myself farther ; and 
 though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she 
 feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so 
 deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may 
 feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable . <end>   936.274664828493

 they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers 
 had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as 
 made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which 
 she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a 
 violent hurry , as Mrs . <end>   385.6831445439708
<start> <start> This was 
 very amiable , but Charlotte 's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth 
 had any conception of ; - - its object was nothing less , than to secure her 
 from any return of Mr . Collins 's addresses , by engaging them towards 
 herself . <end>   760.5947095450613
<start> <start> The walk being here less 
 sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they 
 met . <end>   1023.4127788901014

 lived . <end>   120.53459415964362
<start> <start> But so they always are . <end>   551.4984276986597
<start> <start> Bennet invited him to dine with them ; but , with many 
 expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . <end>   354.19857671517417
<start> <start> Their other engagements were few ; as the style of living of 
 the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the Collinses 'reach . <end>   788.0913501154151
<start> <start> Bennet 's best 
 comfort was , that Mr . Bingley must be down again in the summer . <end>   161.4526807669384

 soon as she was in the hall . <end>   120.74326885700302
<start> <start> They entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , 
 ascended some of the higher grounds ; whence , in spots where the opening 
 of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of 
 the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods 
 overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream . <end>   1310.7783122558744
<start> <start> " But to expose 
 the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present 
 feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . <end>   1010.0577687400217
<start> <start> Do you not know that such a 
 report is spread abroad ? " 
 
 " I never heard that it was . "

<start> <start> Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , 
 not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to Mr . 
 Darcy 's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he 
 has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has 
 treated Mr . Darcy in a most infamous manner . <end>   303.95697173783196

 calmness , if he really intended to meet them . <end>   619.8300141246544

 myself , and of Mr . Wickham too . <end>   43.89425496150318

 morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her 
 contrivance . <end>   74.8201829549356

 and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a 
 mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . <end>   168.78790034756383
<start> <start> There was no arguing upon such a project . <end>   633.6860774637648

 enough to provoke him . <end>   179.26165125461887

 understand it . <end>   133.8248119627467

 The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases , and again during the 
 chief of the day , was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr . Collins . <end>   70.30306532566792

 accomplished for her age ! <end>   1451.1691620036675
<start> <start> He resigned all 
 claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could 
 ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three 
 thousand pounds . <end>   328.45395505706995
<start> <start> Elizabeth however did not chuse to 
 take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the 
 consequence of any reply . <end>   721.5716780387215
<start> <start> " And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real 
 truth ! <end>   599.221155230467
<start> <start> The advice 
 was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head 
 ached acutely . <end>   1243.8166156064542
<start> <start> And is 
 _such_ a girl to be my nephew 's sister ? <end>   994.3057300984697
<start> <start> I wonder he does not marry , to secure a 
 lasting convenience of that kind . <end>   355.0132917818226
<start> <start> If therefore she 
 actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to 
 force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of 
 temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . " 
 
 " Sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said Mrs . <end>   560.4985661030727
<start> <start> We _will_ know where 
 we have gone - - we _will_ recollect what we have seen . <end>   890.8948791269871
<start> <start> The day passed most pleasantly away ; the morning in bustle and 
 shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres . <end>   772.3715442177689
<start> <start> You were 
 not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it . <end>   181.60264374817754
<start> <start> From his garden , Mr . Collins would have led them round his two meadows , 
 but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white 
 frost , turned back ; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte 
 took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , 
 probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband 's 
 help . <end>   786.076522957713
<start> <start> But when they see , 
 as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will 
 learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we 
 can never be what we once were to each other . " 
 
 " That is the most unforgiving speech , " said Elizabeth , " that I ever 
 heard you utter . <end>   211.06666685810936
<start> <start> The 
 quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas 
 of happiness ! <end>   585.8147531589252
<start> <start> Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . <end>   270.2783938648197
<start> <start> Mr . Wickham began the subject himself . <end>   121.84851092582161
<start> <start> It was in the Times and the Courier , I know ; 
 though it was not put in as it ought to be . <end>   187.5065758479611
<start> <start> and 
 yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and 
 ridicule . " 
 
 " And this , " cried Darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , 
 " is your opinion of me ! <end>   209.482470606315
<start> <start> This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but 
 Mrs . <end>   239.48232032427248
<start> <start> As for 
 their mother , Mr . Collins 's letter had done away much of her ill - will , 
 and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which 
 astonished her husband and daughters . <end>   212.59223283128523
<start> <start> They contained no actual complaint , nor was there any 
 revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering . <end>   1638.71147285707
<start> <start> " But , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects 
 delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you 
 while you have been here . " 
 
 Elizabeth made no objection ; - - the door was then allowed to be shut , and 
 the carriage drove off . <end>   181.20520796665326
<start> <start> I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , 
 had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have 
 acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , frankly and openly . " 
 
 Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " Yes , you know enough of 
 my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_ . <end>   442.6815065727218
<start> <start> Besides , it will not much signify what 
 one wears this summer , after the - - - - shire have left Meryton , and they 
 are going in a fortnight . " 
 
 " Are they indeed ? " cried Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction . <end>   181.44343925878147
<start> <start> Have you not heard me say , that from his 
 earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? " 
 
 " Yes , and I had heard it before . <end>   255.49782543967694
<start> <start> The hill , crowned with wood , from 
 which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the 
 distance , was a beautiful object . <end>   1039.1873133431277
<start> <start> " It must make you better satisfied that your other four are 
 single . " 
 
 " It is no such thing . <end>   171.76074528146745
<start> <start> There was no one therefore who could be pointed out , 
 as likely to give any news of him . <end>   152.43774506626465
<start> <start> But I believe your opinion of him would in general 
 astonish - - and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly 
 anywhere else . - - Here you are in your own family . " 
 
 " Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the 
 neighbourhood , except Netherfield . <end>   249.27107039076267
<start> <start> Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . <end>   239.43606317213857
<start> <start> She expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to 
 each , to be dwelt on farther . <end>   814.4719455297497
<start> <start> If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children 
 must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have 
 ever had any thing from him , except a few presents . <end>   238.14941742380253
<start> <start> Her air 
 was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to 
 make her visitors forget their inferior rank . <end>   660.4361289142295
<start> <start> Though suspicion was very far 
 from Miss Bennet 's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . <end>   917.1432237266747
<start> <start> From that moment I 
 observed my friend 's behaviour attentively ; and I could then 
 perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had 
 ever witnessed in him . <end>   551.9003870724491
<start> <start> " It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , " he added , 
 " which was my chief inducement to enter the - - - - shire . <end>   167.27404547104575
<start> <start> How could I 
 be so silly as to wish it ! <end>   202.08317101631422
<start> <start> " I must go instantly to my mother ; " she cried . <end>   145.1718018916169
<start> <start> Collins you 
 have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear 
 that your friend has drawn an unfortunate - - but on this point it will be 
 as well to be silent . <end>   338.8002910349474
<start> <start> His coming into the country at all , is a 
 most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . <end>   192.97806166184128
<start> <start> Elizabeth was delighted . <end>   395.73208500940063
<start> <start> Gardiner was so little to be trusted . " 
 
 " You must not blame my aunt . <end>   79.89417305631976
<start> <start> She owed 
 her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and 
 good - naturedly engaged Mr . Collins 's conversation to herself . <end>   234.16371827851347
<start> <start> " My dear Mr . Bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that 
 Netherfield Park is let at last ? " 
 
 Mr . Bennet replied that he had not . <end>   105.66919784396677
<start> <start> The envelope contained a 
 sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady 's 
 fair , flowing hand ; and Elizabeth saw her sister 's countenance change as 
 she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . <end>   1042.3578397072476
<start> <start> Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children ; and though the 
 man and the match were quite good enough for _her_ , the worth of each 
 was eclipsed by Mr . Bingley and Netherfield . <end>   497.0881270209577
<start> <start> Gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and 
 curtailed its extent . <end>   873.44947391744
<start> <start> She tried , however , to compose herself to 
 answer him with patience , when he should have done . <end>   368.2404052783693
<start> <start> And you saw the 
 old housekeeper , I suppose ? <end>   607.4229648815433
<start> <start> She had never perceived , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that 
 Lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that Lydia had 
 wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body . <end>   304.8020572979062
<start> <start> Good bye . <end>   62.43838330972441
<start> <start> She dared not 
 even mention that gentleman . <end>   203.07658189020074
<start> <start> " I hope , " added Mrs . <end>   30.323193011167845
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said 
 less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; 
 nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . <end>   824.1237368067522
<start> <start> Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs . <end>   525.5132583997131

 interest in him ? " 
 
 " His misfortunes ! " repeated Darcy contemptuously ; " yes , his misfortunes 
 have been great indeed . "

 had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his 
 wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was 
 paid , she had no knowledge of it . <end>   295.2304849976144
<start> <start> Perhaps he thought her too young . <end>   1181.776552700838

 " Yes ; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of 
 their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . <end>   202.62512844521677
<start> <start> It had always been evident to her that such an 
 income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in 
 their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to 
 their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either Jane or 
 herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance 
 towards discharging their bills . <end>   1476.6608355064695
<start> <start> I have therefore made up my mind to tell 
 you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all - - and now despise me if 
 you dare . " 
 
 " Indeed I do not dare . " 
 
 Elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his 
 gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her 
 manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody ; and Darcy had 
 never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her . <end>   357.40253781844496
<start> <start> His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect ; but she 
 could not approve him ; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or 
 feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . <end>   512.7155217504754

 attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . <end>   470.37969853196427
<start> <start> His doing so 
 drew her notice . <end>   339.7968684863129
<start> <start> Such a 
 change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but 
 gratitude - - for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such 
 its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means 
 unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined . <end>   643.30577998591
<start> <start> You know pretty well , I suppose , 
 what has been done for the young people . <end>   161.3536006822078
<start> <start> Lydia , my love , though you _are_ 
 the youngest , I dare say Mr . Bingley will dance with you at the next 
 ball . " 
 
 " Oh ! " said Lydia stoutly , " I am not afraid ; for though I _am_ the 
 youngest , I 'm the tallest . " 
 
 The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would 
 return Mr . Bennet 's visit , and determining when they should ask him to 
 dinner . <end>   157.45163551328375
<start> <start> nonsense , how can you talk so ! <end>   62.490456928253444
<start> <start> He had ruined for a 
 while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart 
 in the world ; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have 
 inflicted . <end>   468.7648464198086
<start> <start> The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received 
 from Lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , 
 if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . <end>   814.4500023808635

 he no longer cares for me , why silent ? <end>   765.2845767578954

 falsehood . <end>   971.4344904285148

 requited . <end>   183.01576773778652
<start> <start> how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a 
 like manner . <end>   183.45656227092095
<start> <start> Accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid 
 whether Pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its 
 proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for 
 the summer . <end>   607.1796801518726
<start> <start> But , my 
 dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me 
 obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour 
 was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . <end>   617.9784499168524

 more unequal , than she had often seen them . <end>   299.664920361481
<start> <start> Sometimes one 
 officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions 
 raised them in her opinion . <end>   1875.4416301801516
<start> <start> At such a moment , the arrival of her friend 
 was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth , though in the course of their 
 meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she 
 saw Mr . Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her 
 husband . <end>   194.54811902352304

 unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister 's having the pleasure

 half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of 
 her sister 's ruin still more certain ; and even Jane , who believed still 
 less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now 
 come , when if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never before 
 entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some 
 news of them . <end>   436.286565612117

<start> <start> Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the 
 commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate 
 in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by 
 Mr . Collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be 
 quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the 
 village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold 
 them into harmony and plenty . <end>   1027.3425661817244

 with a fare from London ; and as he thought the circumstance of a 
 gentleman and lady 's removing from one carriage into another , might be 
 remarked , he meant to make enquiries at Clapham . <end>   354.2101108016521

 person of rank - - such affability and condescension , as he had himself 
 experienced from Lady Catherine . <end>   513.4244195292121
<start> <start> With such rivals for the notice of the fair , as Mr . Wickham and the

 young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a 
 kind listener in Mrs . <end>   385.2625796657324

 connected with the letter he held . <end>   272.1322457694254

 advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . <end>   306.3887491674966
<start> <start> Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real 
 occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to 
 oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her 
 tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it 
 better that _one_ only of the household , and the one whom they could 
 most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the 
 subject . <end>   494.9229767188274

 him ? <end>   777.3078950421144

 ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his 
 disappointment . "

 other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . <end>   344.7006839617048

<start> <start> " How nicely we are crammed in ! " cried Lydia . <end>   193.0901077893519
<start> <start> Your profusion 
 makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will 
 be as light as a feather . " 
 
 " Poor Wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his 
 countenance ! <end>   593.3217976952989
<start> <start> single , my dear , to be sure ! <end>   245.22450684379905
<start> <start> " Can you deny that you have done it ? " she repeated . <end>   384.7898171322975
<start> <start> Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best 
 wishes for your health and happiness . " 
 
 And with these words he hastily left the room , and Elizabeth heard him 
 the next moment open the front door and quit the house . <end>   611.3901088059353
<start> <start> To persuade him against 
 returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , 
 was scarcely the work of a moment . - - I cannot blame myself for 
 having done thus much . <end>   629.6709023179636
<start> <start> All were struck with the stranger 's air , 
 all wondered who he could be , and Kitty and Lydia , determined if 
 possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of 
 wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained 
 the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same 
 spot . <end>   705.3937881152513
<start> <start> Thoughtless and indiscreet I 
 can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) 
 marks nothing bad at heart . <end>   1080.267032385664
<start> <start> Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr . Bingley for his kindness to 
 Jane , with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy . <end>   556.9401339405065
<start> <start> Jane 's is nothing to it - - nothing at all . <end>   99.90771263342323
<start> <start> CHAPTER III . 
 
 
 Not all that Mrs . <end>   34.552688875826924
<start> <start> A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , 
 since you went away . <end>   34.922825402052915
<start> <start> Oh ! <end>   7.296773763321134
<start> <start> She had even 
 learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , 
 an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary . <end>   1010.0419114498875
<start> <start> Tell him I hope he will 
 excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at 
 the next ball we meet , with great pleasure . <end>   532.2414920276545
<start> <start> CHAPTER XV . 
 
 
 The discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw 
 Elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome ; nor could she for many 
 hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly . <end>   350.46323355069103
<start> <start> And her neighbours at 
 Lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the 
 Collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine ) had only 
 set _that_ down , as almost certain and immediate , which _she_ had looked 
 forward to as possible , at some future time . <end>   1081.6606106683116
<start> <start> " By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried 
 letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not 
 confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer 
 for being coherent . <end>   580.1047652507517
<start> <start> Let me hear what it is . " 
 
 " We are speaking of music , Madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid 
 a reply . <end>   60.677244968728886
<start> <start> Console Lady Catherine as well as 
 you can . <end>   211.85404760837235
<start> <start> A small sum could not do all this . " 
 
 " No , " said her father , " Wickham 's a fool , if he takes her with a 
 farthing less than ten thousand pounds . <end>   131.5322659968685
<start> <start> " Next time you call , " said she , " I hope we shall be more lucky . " 
 
 He should be particularly happy at any time , & c . <end>   151.2199601333027
<start> <start> Surprise was the least 
 of her feelings on this developement . <end>   211.09423032611406
<start> <start> " I am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends I do not 
 know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a 
 vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is 
 always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest 
 temper I ever met with . <end>   223.65330057932815
<start> <start> Supposing him to be attached to 
 me , would _my_ refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it 
 on his cousin ? <end>   1174.5221120093008
<start> <start> It would have suited 
 me in every respect . " 
 
 " How should you have liked making sermons ? " 
 
 " Exceedingly well . <end>   161.90745594451994
<start> <start> For herself she was humbled ; but she was proud of him . <end>   389.30170775484885
<start> <start> but from what the report of 
 their engagement could originate , Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine ; 
 till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley , 
 and _her_ being the sister of Jane , was enough , at a time when the 
 expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply 
 the idea . <end>   495.9243395705288
<start> <start> Lydia was Lydia still ; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and 
 fearless . <end>   1348.4338490443042
<start> <start> It was borne in the latter with decent 
 philosophy . <end>   634.7441423400192
<start> <start> And then we were so merry all the way home ! <end>   1006.2327872035968
<start> <start> A lady 's 
 imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love 
 to matrimony in a moment . <end>   1281.3272014276415
<start> <start> " There is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said Kitty ; " who can it be ? " 
 
 " Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not 
 know . " 
 
 " La ! " replied Kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with 
 him before . <end>   129.4842235938981
<start> <start> The comfort to _her_ , 
 of the regiment 's approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . <end>   383.54931786664366
<start> <start> Lydia came to 
 us ; and Wickham had constant admission to the house . <end>   313.9040739880013
<start> <start> They were , therefore , to go . - - Elizabeth was pleased , though , 
 when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . <end>   133.32911035198592
<start> <start> I knew you would be wishing me joy . " 
 
 " Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as 
 absolutely settled . <end>   258.2010316224999
<start> <start> I can hardly write for 
 laughing . <end>   703.0027891745692
<start> <start> As for Jane , _her_ anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more 
 painful than Elizabeth 's ; but whatever she felt she was desirous of 
 concealing , and between herself and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject 
 was never alluded to . <end>   609.5416373355041
<start> <start> Mr . Collins made his 
 declaration in form . <end>   142.22375930635775
<start> <start> If she is half as sharp as her mother , 
 she is saving enough . <end>   631.5737749187041
<start> <start> I am particularly unlucky 
 in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a 
 part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree 
 of credit . <end>   276.4247509814079
<start> <start> While the contents of the first 
 letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise - - all astonishment that 
 Wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for 
 money ; and how Lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared 
 incomprehensible . <end>   713.2448632231456
<start> <start> She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of 
 bringing them together ; that the whole of the visit would not pass away 
 without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than 
 the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . <end>   459.6907144816243
<start> <start> I 
 always had a value for him . <end>   173.2862941736873
<start> <start> " The first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be 
 in company with either of them . <end>   97.30439181005517
<start> <start> Her 
 heart did whisper , that he had done it for her . <end>   153.67566326247552
<start> <start> Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own 
 disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of 
 such an enormity , at so early an age . <end>   305.46058552916304
<start> <start> why is not every body as happy ? " 
 
 Elizabeth 's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a 
 delight , which words could but poorly express . <end>   636.1483349266881
<start> <start> Gardiner . <end>   13.070694578734168
<start> <start> They were able to love each 
 other , even as well as they intended . <end>   266.75900813767953
<start> <start> He 
 must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found 
 her . " 
 
 " But does Lydia know nothing of this ? <end>   127.06129155216759
<start> <start> Bennet 
 wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much 
 trouble , and was sure Jane would have caught cold again . - - But their 
 father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really 
 glad to see them ; he had felt their importance in the family circle . <end>   643.2414078340807
<start> <start> _I_ only 
 want to think _you_ perfect , and you set yourself against it . <end>   1757.305407018961
<start> <start> She has a very good notion 
 of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne 's . <end>   701.6437492743237
<start> <start> Elizabeth , construing all 
 this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased ; and on 
 this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors 
 left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some 
 satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been 
 little . <end>   321.75701344192163
<start> <start> When Mr . Collins could be 
 forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by 
 Charlotte 's evident enjoyment of it , Elizabeth supposed he must be often 
 forgotten . <end>   484.6102436865624
<start> <start> I saw them the night before last . " 
 
 Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from 
 Charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling . <end>   800.6088516907323
<start> <start> I am very , very sorry . <end>   150.09348567264104
<start> <start> The more I see 
 of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms 
 my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the 
 little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit 
 or sense . <end>   580.1300542768382
<start> <start> I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr . Collins 's 
 character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my 
 chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on 
 entering the marriage state . " 
 
 Elizabeth quietly answered " Undoubtedly ; " - - and after an awkward pause , 
 they returned to the rest of the family . <end>   168.82747054306296
<start> <start> Gardiner had seen Pemberley , and known the late Mr . Darcy by 
 character perfectly well . <end>   293.99710177349976
<start> <start> Mr . Wickham , after a few moments , 
 touched his hat - - a salutation which Mr . Darcy just deigned to return . <end>   153.36785317252279
<start> <start> Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in 
 London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they 
 would have taken up their abode with her . <end>   267.50770902387603
<start> <start> Let us hope for 
 better things . <end>   241.94769010511058
<start> <start> But of every other neglect 
 I can believe him capable . <end>   1766.7864650605682
<start> <start> CHAPTER XVIII . 
 
 
 Till Elizabeth entered the drawing - room at Netherfield and looked in 
 vain for Mr . Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a 
 doubt of his being present had never occurred to her . <end>   204.5941440835224
<start> <start> Do not involve 
 yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of 
 fortune would make so very imprudent . <end>   1103.4188999184425
<start> <start> Her character 
 will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt 
 that ever made herself and her family ridiculous . <end>   471.40117575661236
<start> <start> He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again 
 on Wednesday or Thursday . <end>   594.3081926312929
<start> <start> The particulars , I reserve till we meet . <end>   834.5899377969329
<start> <start> They travelled as expeditiously as possible ; and sleeping one night on 
 the road , reached Longbourn by dinner - time the next day . <end>   322.60807547181383
<start> <start> His words 
 seemed to imply it . <end>   380.3470130631757
<start> <start> She lost all concern for him in 
 finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous 
 gallantry ; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the 
 reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever 
 cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified 
 and her preference secured at any time by their renewal . <end>   1226.8691005938074
<start> <start> Miss Bingley warmly 
 resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her 
 brother for talking such nonsense . <end>   1077.0965456370798
<start> <start> I thought him very sly ; - - he hardly ever 
 mentioned your name . <end>   628.7609557021099
<start> <start> " I often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with 
 one 's friends . <end>   89.34923303137995
<start> <start> Younger sons cannot marry 
 where they like . " 
 
 " Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often 
 do . " 
 
 " Our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in 
 my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to 
 money . " 
 
 " Is this , " thought Elizabeth , " meant for me ? " and she coloured at the 
 idea ; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " And pray , what is 
 the usual price of an Earl 's younger son ? <end>   362.75222636820354
<start> <start> " That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , " said Mrs . <end>   32.311514413303875
<start> <start> But the 
 clothes , the wedding clothes ! <end>   1134.1352049923678
<start> <start> Charlotte 's first letters 
 were received with a good deal of eagerness ; there could not but be 
 curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would 
 like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to 
 be ; though , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte 
 expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . <end>   668.0090487050919
<start> <start> Mr . Gardiner would be prevented by business from 
 setting out till a fortnight later in July , and must be in London again 
 within a month ; and as that left too short a period for them to go so 
 far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with 
 the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up 
 the Lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour ; and , according to the 
 present plan , were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire . <end>   568.3009489491557
<start> <start> Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will 
 keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an 
 object of prey to any body . <end>   215.46672336189297
<start> <start> You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do , when I 
 tell you all . " 
 
 " What do you mean ? " 
 
 " Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley . <end>   88.61786981974305
<start> <start> " I do not blame Jane , " she continued , " for Jane would have got Mr . 
 Bingley , if she could . <end>   67.9583917019433
<start> <start> Miss Bingley was 
 engrossed by Mr . Darcy , her sister scarcely less so ; and as for Mr . 
 Hurst , by whom Elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to 
 eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish 
 to a ragout , had nothing to say to her . <end>   391.4162454945347
<start> <start> After sitting a little while with Jane , on Miss 
 Bingley 's appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all 
 attended her into the breakfast parlour . <end>   284.65705108251854
<start> <start> The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and 
 he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its 
 cookery was owing . <end>   724.8333876281828
<start> <start> I should have considered it as part of my duty , and 
 the exertion would soon have been nothing . <end>   320.4303436755
<start> <start> " There has 
 been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way . <end>   585.1115400929049
<start> <start> I never saw such a long chin in my life . <end>   45.80669266070012
<start> <start> yes . - - Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be 
 placed in the gallery at Pemberley . <end>   492.7301927182611
<start> <start> Our 
 importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the 
 wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark 
 Lydia 's character . <end>   403.39832791430155
<start> <start> With _them_ he is remarkably 
 agreeable . " 
 
 " I do not believe a word of it , my dear . <end>   39.503678657730006
<start> <start> Bennet . <end>   10.318399796512947
<start> <start> My good qualities are under your protection , and you are 
 to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me 
 to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may 
 be ; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling 
 to come to the point at last . <end>   446.3018617167862
<start> <start> But why Mr . Darcy came so often to the Parsonage , it was more difficult 
 to understand . <end>   664.9986624969706
<start> <start> " Mr . Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , 
 is he ? - - Poor Eliza ! - - to be only just _tolerable_ . " 
 
 " I beg you would not put it into Lizzy 's head to be vexed by his 
 ill - treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite 
 a misfortune to be liked by him . <end>   259.2972820903448
<start> <start> I have suspected it some time , but 
 I am now convinced . " 
 
 Catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Lydia , with perfect 
 indifference , continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter , and 
 her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the 
 next morning to London . <end>   125.40999012838016
<start> <start> Her hair so untidy , so blowsy ! " 
 
 " Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep 
 in mud , I am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to 
 hide it , not doing its office . " 
 
 " Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , " said Bingley ; " but this was 
 all lost upon me . <end>   359.602046670833
<start> <start> Elizabeth could not help saying , " It is 
 very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . " 
 
 " I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows 
 him , " replied the other . <end>   83.31239381307428
<start> <start> " Do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be 
 prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . <end>   159.69719239474557
<start> <start> In a few minutes , Mrs . <end>   8.051594856767771
<start> <start> Their lodgings were not long a secret , 
 and at length they began to know the officers themselves . <end>   518.5294350557998
<start> <start> Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject 
 of discourse . <end>   2761.8253336059856
<start> <start> I 
 am sure my sisters must all envy me . <end>   431.9390670074791
<start> <start> A regard for the requester would often make 
 one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason 
 one into it . <end>   1438.234129561685
<start> <start> She 
 looked at Jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns . <end>   54.696563781705656
<start> <start> If his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , 
 _he_ was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that 
 Jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . <end>   578.0224455262676
<start> <start> But he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no 
 extraordinary stretch of belief . <end>   609.0478050977077
<start> <start> Towards _him_ I have been 
 kinder than towards myself . " 
 
 Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , 
 but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her . <end>   480.43553260063135
<start> <start> But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely 
 they should have opposed their brother 's . <end>   253.99745625759752
<start> <start> I know no harm of her . " 
 
 " But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather 's 
 death made her mistress of this fortune . " 
 
 " No - - why should he ? <end>   237.09705635759872
<start> <start> In Three Volumes . <end>   4.533491998641342
<start> <start> Miss Bingley offered her the carriage , and she only 
 wanted a little pressing to accept it , when Jane testified such concern 
 in parting with her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer 
 of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the 
 present . <end>   280.0152403813936
<start> <start> I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for 
 Purvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful . " 
 
 Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the 
 servants remained . <end>   512.2928603465328

 _is_ a shade in a character . <end>   559.4212918696653
<start> <start> You dare not , 
 you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means 
 of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the 
 world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for 
 disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest 
 kind . "

 with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse . <end>   730.2570026777414

 perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any 
 design of engaging my affection . <end>   163.49239278633712

<start> <start> After playing some Italian songs , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a 
 lively Scotch air ; and soon afterwards Mr . Darcy , drawing near 
 Elizabeth , said to her - - 
 
 " Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an 
 opportunity of dancing a reel ? " 
 
 She smiled , but made no answer . <end>   181.7398384646781
<start> <start> I remember the time when I 
 liked a red coat myself very well - - and indeed so I do still at my heart ; 
 and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should 
 want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel 
 Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William 's in his 
 regimentals . " 
 
 " Mama , " cried Lydia , " my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain 
 Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson 's as they did when they first 
 came ; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke 's library . "

 hatefully mercenary ; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer 
 the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing . <end>   990.9444161512093
<start> <start> Their 
 arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets ; and Jane more especially , 
 who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had _she_ 
 been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must 
 endure . <end>   1033.2336851437374

 mistaken - - or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of

 Darcy may hug himself . " 
 
 " Mr . Darcy is not to be laughed at ! " cried Elizabeth . <end>   29.426086295337168
<start> <start> Though I 
 _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though I would not injure him 
 so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on 
 setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to 
 you . " 
 
 " If you believed it impossible to be true , " said Elizabeth , colouring 
 with astonishment and disdain , " I wonder you took the trouble of coming 
 so far . <end>   235.36537007782002

<start> <start> The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will 
 prove what she felt . <end>   341.0269220076949
<start> <start> But against this , there were objections ; and she finally 
 resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as 
 to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered . <end>   319.16407532421835

 him , so think it no harm to be off . <end>   305.3977773056307

 worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond 
 youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and emptiness of 
 her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal 
 contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . <end>   1386.7894105608393

<start> <start> As I must 
 therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I 
 shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by 
 suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . " 
 
 " I do assure you , Sir , that I have no pretension whatever to that kind 
 of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man . <end>   383.09972812114887
<start> <start> Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than Elizabeth ; and , though 
 little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance 
 womanly and graceful . <end>   694.7793194335119
<start> <start> The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was 
 as sincere as her brother 's in sending it . <end>   886.0451385425217
<start> <start> It was really a very 
 handsome thought . <end>   230.26763043467858
<start> <start> Bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes 
 conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected ; with 
 tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous 
 conduct of Wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage ; 
 blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the 
 errors of her daughter must be principally owing . <end>   1126.151066926193
<start> <start> Your uncle is as much surprised as I am - - and nothing 
 but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed 
 him to act as he has done . <end>   355.6439153818214
<start> <start> In the afternoon , the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an 
 hour by themselves ; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the 
 opportunity of making many enquiries , which Jane was equally eager to 
 satisfy . <end>   455.5532131455281
<start> <start> " Oh ! <end>   4.2396923682408225
<start> <start> I cannot 
 acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should 
 omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected 
 with the family . " And with a bow to Mr . Darcy , he concluded his speech , 
 which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . - - Many 
 stared . - - Many smiled ; but no one looked more amused than Mr . Bennet 
 himself , while his wife seriously commended Mr . Collins for having 
 spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half - whisper to Lady Lucas , that 
 he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . <end>   409.4103238479208

 own future property . <end>   496.75134371429715

 out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , 
 " Is not this nice ? <end>   2286.593909245837
<start> <start> We can all 
 _begin_ freely - - a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are 
 very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without 
 encouragement . <end>   1154.680452401083
<start> <start> Her brother 's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his 
 judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth , as 
 to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than 
 lovely and amiable . <end>   566.3836836744433
<start> <start> It cannot be for _me_ , it cannot be for _my_ sake 
 that his manners are thus softened . <end>   276.65423505033215
<start> <start> Mr . Collins 's present 
 circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom 
 they could give little fortune ; and his prospects of future wealth were 
 exceedingly fair . <end>   348.04204518382136
<start> <start> She 
 could think of nothing else , and yet whether Bingley 's regard had really 
 died away , or were suppressed by his friends 'interference ; whether he 
 had been aware of Jane 's attachment , or whether it had escaped his 
 observation ; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be 
 materially affected by the difference , her sister 's situation remained 
 the same , her peace equally wounded . <end>   562.4421500651337
<start> <start> Such a countenance , such manners ! <end>   977.7531783334512
<start> <start> The darling wish of his 
 sisters was then gratified ; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county 
 to Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to every other source 
 of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . <end>   445.3598674500177
<start> <start> Though our kind 
 uncle has done something towards clearing him , I cannot believe that ten 
 thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced . <end>   552.4603140053638
<start> <start> I have great hopes of finding him quite the 
 reverse . <end>   1066.981979151268
<start> <start> It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of 
 short duration . <end>   190.07809937436863
<start> <start> Had he done his duty in that 
 respect , Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of 
 honour or credit could now be purchased for her . <end>   860.0919340100202

 say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world . <end>   114.14719430529509

<start> <start> His sense of her inferiority - - of 
 its being a degradation - - of the family obstacles which judgment had 
 always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed 
 due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to 
 recommend his suit . <end>   1422.9355812990823

 indeed without much graciousness , but Mrs . <end>   673.5422386781089

 spirits , there were periods of dejection . <end>   347.6461095696206

 must be of all others most afflicting to a parent 's mind . <end>   668.5170890584639
<start> <start> Her uncle and aunt were all amazement ; and the embarrassment 
 of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many 
 of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on 
 the business . <end>   498.889841954185

 clothes must reflect on her daughter 's nuptials , than to any sense of 
 shame at her eloping and living with Wickham , a fortnight before they 
 took place . <end>   546.9093932612203
<start> <start> There was no want of discourse . <end>   156.37354731136506

 The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her 
 story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a 
 reproach ; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon 
 regained her composure , and calmly replied , 
 
 " Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? - - Do you think it incredible 
 that Mr . Collins should be able to procure any woman 's good opinion , 
 because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " 
 
 But Elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort 
 for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect 
 of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished 
 her all imaginable happiness . <end>   360.2745748216616

<start> <start> If you love Mr . Darcy half as well as I do my dear 
 Wickham , you must be very happy . <end>   108.68848229307746
<start> <start> Elizabeth went away with her head full of him . <end>   575.1957678032189
<start> <start> Nor was Darcy 's vindication , though 
 grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . <end>   739.1266610773489

 disagreeable . " 
 
 " A little sea - bathing would set me up for ever . " 
 
 " And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good , " 
 added Kitty . <end>   114.41232874875021

 Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as 
 soon as she possibly could . <end>   35.943573045869584
<start> <start> The 
 liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! " 
 
 She was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real 
 state of her sister 's spirits . <end>   301.43047451396274
<start> <start> Bingley was quite uncomfortable ; his sisters 
 declared that they were miserable . <end>   1024.181776767544
<start> <start> Mr . Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday ; on Tuesday , his wife received a 
 letter from him ; it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately 
 found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street . <end>   420.5061453103959
<start> <start> But 
 Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . <end>   119.06019263140169
<start> <start> The expression 
 of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and 
 steady gravity . <end>   1200.0751899400902
<start> <start> Our 
 instrument is a capital one , probably superior to - - - - You shall try it 
 some day . - - Do your sisters play and sing ? " 
 
 " One of them does . " 
 
 " Why did not you all learn ? - - You ought all to have learned . <end>   511.72555220974834
<start> <start> This preservative she had now 
 obtained ; and at the age of twenty - seven , without having ever been 
 handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . <end>   314.9125752490971
<start> <start> He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London . " 
 
 " Perfectly so - - I thank you . " 
 
 She found that she was to receive no other answer - - and , after a short 
 pause , added , 
 
 " I think I have understood that Mr . Bingley has not much idea of ever 
 returning to Netherfield again ? " 
 
 " I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend 
 very little of his time there in future . <end>   109.55715417670294
<start> <start> Though Lydia 's short 
 letter to Mrs . <end>   547.9895730443133
<start> <start> You are lucky in 
 having such a master . " 
 
 " Yes , Sir , I know I am . <end>   70.96150119704942
<start> <start> As it was certain , however , that 
 somebody was coming , Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid 
 the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the 
 shrubbery . <end>   736.0308604246202
<start> <start> But Mr . Bennet was not of a 
 disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own 
 imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often 
 console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice . <end>   642.3395689854676

 " You are mistaken . <end>   58.47109153946701
<start> <start> Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay . <end>   271.4568162375906
<start> <start> Gardiner , though unknown . <end>   51.863053767474014
<start> <start> Her father had been an attorney in Meryton , and 
 had left her four thousand pounds . <end>   366.5536841008948
<start> <start> A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his 
 features , but he said not a word , and Elizabeth , though blaming herself 
 for her own weakness , could not go on . <end>   179.8062898665676
<start> <start> He has 
 more to give . <end>   43.66692221819703
<start> <start> What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing 's Park , when 
 he put his letter into her hand ! <end>   885.7458127572409
<start> <start> Annesley , a 
 genteel , agreeable - looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind 
 of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the 
 others ; and between her and Mrs . <end>   774.4462036724412
<start> <start> " 'Tis an etiquette I despise , " said he . <end>   221.38702629955793
<start> <start> Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , 
 heard it in silent indignation . <end>   268.8571726383991
<start> <start> But think no more of the letter . <end>   33.339331078054215
<start> <start> We are not on friendly terms , 
 and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for 
 avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world ; a sense of 
 very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . <end>   492.1764180880049
<start> <start> I thought I should have broke my heart . " 
 
 " I am sure I shall break _mine_ , " said Lydia . <end>   46.567624909438344
<start> <start> Well , any friend of 
 Mr . Bingley 's will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else I must 
 say that I hate the very sight of him . " 
 
 Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern . <end>   280.7538932373185
<start> <start> " It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " 
 continued her mother , " but at the same time , Mr . Bingley , it is very 
 hard to have her taken such a way from me . <end>   73.27010277533154
<start> <start> But his pride , his abominable pride , his 
 shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane , his 
 unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , 
 and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr . Wickham , his 
 cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the 
 pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . <end>   563.1898632781136
<start> <start> Jane was by no means better . <end>   45.387522777517326
<start> <start> He did look at it and into it for half an 
 hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied 
 with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . <end>   618.1052553440591
<start> <start> Mr . Wickham 
 had received his commission before he left London , and he was to join 
 his regiment at the end of a fortnight . <end>   90.49792829002403
<start> <start> Elizabeth reserved to herself the 
 application for her mother 's . <end>   347.1580161322374
<start> <start> He merely added , that he should not write 
 again , till he had something of importance to mention . " 
 
 " And my mother - - How is she ? <end>   231.79383311208267
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> But Mr . Gardiner 
 could not be seen , and Mr . Darcy found , on further enquiry , that 
 your father was still with him , but would quit town the next 
 morning . <end>   171.66719513281527
<start> <start> It had given him a 
 disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town ; and 
 quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a 
 mile from Meryton , denominated from that period Lucas Lodge , where he 
 could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by 
 business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world . <end>   525.2369731913836
<start> <start> That had 
 his actions been what Wickham represented them , so gross a violation of 
 every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world ; and 
 that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man 
 as Mr . Bingley , was incomprehensible . <end>   535.6179758972057
<start> <start> There was not much in the 
 question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner 
 which gave them meaning . <end>   212.57575443621943
<start> <start> When they parted , Lady Catherine , with great condescension , wished them 
 a good journey , and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year ; 
 and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her 
 hand to both . <end>   349.8765358333503
<start> <start> You supposed more than 
 really existed . <end>   960.0014556764451
<start> <start> There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds . <end>   68.31694434357647
<start> <start> If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ 
 affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for 
 making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally 
 poor ? " 
 
 " But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so 
 soon after this event . " 
 
 " A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant 
 decorums which other people may observe . <end>   450.7152846993208
<start> <start> " While Mary is adjusting her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to Mr . 
 Bingley . " 
 
 " I am sick of Mr . Bingley , " cried his wife . <end>   39.80325000607371
<start> <start> Widely 
 different was the effect of a second perusal . - - How could she deny that 
 credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to 
 give in the other ? - - He declared himself to have been totally 
 unsuspicious of her sister 's attachment ; - - and she could not help 
 remembering what Charlotte 's opinion had always been . - - Neither could she 
 deny the justice of his description of Jane . - - She felt that Jane 's 
 feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a 
 constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great 
 sensibility . <end>   320.1428463350441
<start> <start> In the hall they parted . <end>   740.6927340053365
<start> <start> The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , 
 about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again . <end>   698.6746731383175
<start> <start> I would go and see her , if I could have the 
 carriage . " 
 
 Elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though 
 the carriage was not to be had ; and as she was no horse - woman , walking 
 was her only alternative . <end>   164.63905869027664
<start> <start> But the fact is , that we are very 
 different sort of men , and that he hates me . " 
 
 " This is quite shocking ! - - He deserves to be publicly disgraced . " 
 
 " Some time or other he _will_ be - - but it shall not be by _me_ . <end>   166.83448665340603
<start> <start> But 
 these are not Jane 's feelings ; she is not acting by design . <end>   804.1371211262517
<start> <start> Elizabeth , on her side , had much to do . <end>   56.28995193129363
<start> <start> Gardiner ; and after relating the 
 circumstances , she thus went on : - - " I am now convinced , my dear aunt , 
 that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that 
 pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , 
 and wish him all manner of evil . <end>   349.0863358131615
<start> <start> Mr . Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth . <end>   150.52403720866081
<start> <start> She related the subject 
 of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the 
 furniture , in vain . <end>   487.42087995962294
<start> <start> " There is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a 
 pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , - - Will you allow 
 me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance 
 during your stay at Lambton ? " 
 
 The surprise of such an application was great indeed ; it was too great 
 for her to know in what manner she acceded to it . <end>   234.5517156586279
<start> <start> Elizabeth 
 was surprised , however , that Wickham should consent to such a scheme , 
 and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him 
 would have been the last object of her wishes . <end>   190.94968103385776
<start> <start> His debts are to be paid , 
 amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , 
 another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_ , and his 
 commission purchased . <end>   329.8813235758674
<start> <start> Her heart was divided between concern 
 for her sister , and resentment against all the others . <end>   100.691067847002
<start> <start> But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse ; give a 
 loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible 
 flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me 
 actually married , you cannot greatly err . <end>   975.5304798436339
<start> <start> But before she had been three minutes in her own room , 
 her mother followed her . <end>   149.71758331377825
<start> <start> Mr . Bingley was good looking and gentleman - like ; he had a pleasant 
 countenance , and easy , unaffected manners . <end>   263.9926661794662
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> " If I , " said Mr . Collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I 
 should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an 
 air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly 
 compatible with the profession of a clergyman . - - I do not mean however to 
 assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to 
 music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . <end>   345.76421983030923
<start> <start> The whole of what Elizabeth had already 
 heard , his claims on Mr . Darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , 
 was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and every body was 
 pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr . Darcy before they 
 had known any thing of the matter . <end>   261.3206707020368
<start> <start> The 
 possibility of meeting Mr . Darcy , while viewing the place , instantly 
 occurred . <end>   295.91610422239677

<start> <start> They must all go to Brighton . <end>   82.43637234150208
<start> <start> On distinguishing the ladies of the group , 
 the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual 
 civilities . <end>   325.20051787105007
<start> <start> I have been meditating on the very great pleasure 
 which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . " 
 
 Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he 
 would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections . <end>   531.7744563942151
<start> <start> She was not the better pleased with his 
 gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more . - - It now first 
 struck her , that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of 
 being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage , and of assisting to form a 
 quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors . <end>   570.0403190215458
<start> <start> Bennet could not give her consent , or 
 speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , 
 though she talked to Bingley of nothing else , for half an hour ; and when 
 Mr . Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed 
 how really happy he was . <end>   577.261759942783
<start> <start> Pray make my excuses to Pratt , for not keeping my 
 engagement , and dancing with him to - night . <end>   1087.3307417024919
<start> <start> " Lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ? <end>   27.064008903814887
<start> <start> After a short silence , the lady first spoke . <end>   80.37247286976259
<start> <start> How you must have hated me after _that_ evening ? " 
 
 " Hate you ! <end>   216.16297965171213
<start> <start> _I_ should be 
 ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . "

<start> <start> Oh ! <end>   7.296773763321134
<start> <start> The rest of the evening brought her little amusement . <end>   112.01862441668258
<start> <start> We must trespass 
 a little longer on your kindness . " 
 
 " Removed ! " cried Bingley . <end>   175.32098351710147
<start> <start> here comes Hill . <end>   617.7073369487734
<start> <start> Had his own happiness , however , been 
 the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what 
 ever manner he thought best ; but her sister 's was involved in it , as she 
 thought he must be sensible himself . <end>   303.9007036405093
<start> <start> Upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been 
 sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward 
 with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the 
 satisfaction she had promised herself . <end>   458.5170766567008
<start> <start> Though Mr . Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , 
 he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation 
 must have been benefited by marriage . <end>   202.74468361620296

<start> <start> First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . <end>   676.6685983087239
<start> <start> But above all , above respect and esteem , 
 there was a motive within her of good will which could not be 
 overlooked . <end>   651.0253849213472
<start> <start> She had known , it seems , 
 of their being in love with each other , many weeks . " 
 
 " But not before they went to Brighton ? " 
 
 " No , I believe not . " 
 
 " And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ? <end>   98.02483677582606
<start> <start> There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings ! " 
 
 She was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup 
 himself ; and she seized the opportunity of saying , 
 
 " Is your sister at Pemberley still ? " 
 
 " Yes , she will remain there till Christmas . " 
 
 " And quite alone ? <end>   159.80257256806942
<start> <start> While 
 she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened 
 complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with 
 confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . <end>   405.48649123109107
<start> <start> She had not at first thought very seriously of 
 going thither ; but Charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , 
 and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure 
 as well as greater certainty . <end>   667.2830227196428
<start> <start> but the gentlemen will have Mr . Bingley 's chaise to go to Meryton ; 
 and the Hursts have no horses to theirs . "

 ourselves intentionally injured . <end>   397.7483772731283
<start> <start> Her fellow - travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think 
 him less agreeable . <end>   262.8920232682349
<start> <start> " 'Tis too much ! " she added , " by far too much . <end>   146.60050329989002
<start> <start> Elizabeth was not surprised at it , as 
 Jane had written the direction remarkably ill . <end>   595.8859649519592
<start> <start> Jane met her with a smile of 
 such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently 
 marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the 
 evening . - - Elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment 
 solicitude for Wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing 
 else gave way before the hope of Jane 's being in the fairest way for 
 happiness . <end>   325.1500961494831

<start> <start> Younge was of course removed from 
 her charge . <end>   472.88209806479466
<start> <start> Wickham 's affection for Lydia , was just what Elizabeth had expected to 
 find it ; not equal to Lydia 's for him . <end>   362.89429289466847
<start> <start> In his present 
 behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , 
 for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which 
 had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after 
 what had since passed , to provoke her . <end>   621.5747212280928
<start> <start> Bennet , in short , was in very great spirits ; she had seen enough of 
 Bingley 's behaviour to Jane , to be convinced that she would get him at 
 last ; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy 
 humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at 
 not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals . <end>   367.0285078465739

 Mr . Bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued 
 silent till they reached the house . <end>   52.723271199889

 round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were 
 to have on the morrow . <end>   1078.5247103929214

 any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some 
 peculiarities , has abilities which Mr . Darcy himself need not disdain ,

 of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would 
 not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr . 
 Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from 
 the want of importance in his friend 's connections , than from their want 
 of sense ; and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly 
 governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of 
 retaining Mr . Bingley for his sister . <end>   439.2601930316255

 help reverting once more to the first , and saying ,

 gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when Elizabeth 
 called out ,

 believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to

 " You are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! - - always wanting me 
 to play and sing before any body and every body ! - - If my vanity had taken 
 a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , I would 
 really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of 
 hearing the very best performers . " On Miss Lucas 's persevering , however , 
 she added , " Very well ; if it must be so , it must . " And gravely glancing 
 at Mr . Darcy , " There is a fine old saying , which every body here is of 
 course familiar with - - 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge ,' - - and I 
 shall keep mine to swell my song . "

 however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually 
 done before ; and she asked Bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in 
 the country at present . <end>   375.5968362740413

 our own vanity that deceives us . <end>   414.1175485463921
<start> <start> As they walked home , Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass 
 between the two gentlemen ; but though Jane would have defended either or 
 both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such 
 behaviour than her sister . <end>   465.1127965087655

 hastened to console Lady Catherine , and her daughter ; and on his return , 
 brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her Ladyship , 
 importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of 
 having them all to dine with her . <end>   545.0138434957727

 strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so 
 unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils 
 arising from so ill - judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly 
 used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , 
 even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife . <end>   904.0923687133699

 Mr . Bennet 's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two 
 thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in 
 default of heirs male , on a distant relation ; and their mother 's 
 fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply 
 the deficiency of his . <end>   349.0356314741372

<start> <start> There - - I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; 
 and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly 
 reasonable . <end>   309.2654538301755
<start> <start> The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters 
 and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of Miss 
 Darcy and the amusements of London , might be too much , she feared , for 
 the strength of his attachment . <end>   424.7360939422152
<start> <start> At first there 
 seemed danger of Lydia 's engrossing him entirely , for she was a most 
 determined talker ; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , 
 she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets 
 and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in 
 particular . <end>   441.9157581264485
<start> <start> Her father , contented with laughing at 
 them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his 
 youngest daughters ; and her mother , with manners so far from right 
 herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . <end>   801.3120607272073
<start> <start> " You look pale . <end>   286.4761104667105
<start> <start> They met again on Sunday , and 
 then _I_ saw him too . <end>   658.5249481344764
<start> <start> Forster , and the probability of her being yet more 
 imprudent with such a companion at Brighton , where the temptations must 
 be greater than at home . <end>   302.6941547469176
<start> <start> They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the 
 world . <end>   164.11871468812336
<start> <start> Mr . Collins , awkward and solemn , 
 apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being 
 aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable 
 partner for a couple of dances can give . <end>   539.9992179930914
<start> <start> Her thoughts were all fixed on that 
 one spot of Pemberley House , whichever it might be , where Mr . Darcy then 
 was . <end>   233.6446355320135
<start> <start> I 
 shall now know how to act . <end>   436.78994376976
<start> <start> Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed 
 above them all ! <end>   617.466963209033
<start> <start> I hope we 
 may often meet again . " 
 
 Elizabeth smiled . <end>   100.44566597255235
<start> <start> " Come , Darcy , " said he , " I must have you dance . <end>   63.690167492120345
<start> <start> Not a word passed 
 between the sisters concerning Bingley ; but Elizabeth went to bed in 
 the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless Mr . Darcy 
 returned within the stated time . <end>   689.3150806809689
<start> <start> Other schemes too came into her head . <end>   529.7490533098436
<start> <start> My faults , according to this 
 calculation , are heavy indeed ! <end>   465.9099525553193
<start> <start> They are not married , 
 nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are 
 willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on 
 your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . <end>   279.87225803573466
<start> <start> But it is all , all too late now . " 
 
 " I am grieved , indeed , " cried Darcy ; " grieved - - shocked . <end>   124.5504955158595
<start> <start> CHAPTER V . 
 
 
 " I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they 
 drove from the town ; " and really , upon serious consideration , I am much 
 more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the 
 matter . <end>   161.0338501317505
<start> <start> Bennet . <end>   10.318399796512947
<start> <start> " Not yet , " replied Jane . <end>   140.45784816006596
<start> <start> Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield 
 party . <end>   239.2304864201966
<start> <start> She retreated from the window , fearful of being seen ; and as she walked 
 up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks 
 of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse . <end>   301.83220733509745
<start> <start> The housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a 
 young gentleman , the son of her late master 's steward , who had been 
 brought up by him at his own expence . - - " He is now gone into the army , " 
 she added , " but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . " 
 
 Mrs . <end>   166.03555949285604
<start> <start> I speak 
 feelingly . <end>   939.0009164884767
<start> <start> It 
 was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when Mr . Collins joining 
 in , observed , 
 
 " Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine 
 de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will 
 be delighted with her . <end>   156.92306344923847
<start> <start> Society , I own , is necessary to me . <end>   417.2633780784971
<start> <start> And this consideration leads me moreover to 
 reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last 
 November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in 
 all your sorrow and disgrace . <end>   1188.843792946208
<start> <start> I was very 
 uncomfortable , I may say unhappy . <end>   119.38021179055833
<start> <start> CHAPTER X . 
 
 
 More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park , unexpectedly 
 meet Mr . Darcy . - - She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that 
 should bring him where no one else was brought ; and to prevent its ever 
 happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a 
 favourite haunt of hers . - - How it could occur a second time therefore was 
 very odd ! - - Yet it did , and even a third . <end>   512.4164972345815
<start> <start> I have not _that_ pain . <end>   79.73175770858082
<start> <start> Bennet had no more to say ; and Lady Lucas , who 
 had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no 
 likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken . <end>   456.2886260088503
<start> <start> Well , I was so frightened I did not 
 know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond 
 the hour , we could not be married all day . <end>   251.4884576901762
<start> <start> They descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , 
 while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of 
 meeting its owner returned . <end>   603.3249913389166
<start> <start> Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , 
 never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting . <end>   1854.8382180411552
<start> <start> You had better return to your partner and enjoy her 
 smiles , for you are wasting your time with me . " 
 
 Mr . Bingley followed his advice . <end>   347.3526592870639
<start> <start> But our visitor 
 was very obstinate . <end>   1746.324286501505
<start> <start> It is a nice long walk , and Mr . Darcy has 
 never seen the view . " 
 
 " It may do very well for the others , " replied Mr . Bingley ; " but I am 
 sure it will be too much for Kitty . <end>   92.90313188874111
<start> <start> He was then , he said , on his way to Longbourn on 
 purpose to inquire after her . <end>   301.1277480248392
<start> <start> I wish you had been there , my 
 dear , to have given him one of your set downs . <end>   305.4957470904686
<start> <start> One cannot wonder that so 
 very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , 
 should think highly of himself . <end>   395.5340870708737
<start> <start> Bennet and Kitty walked off , and as 
 soon as they were gone Mr . Collins began . <end>   64.98650659191952
<start> <start> His anxiety for Jane was evident , and his 
 attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling 
 herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the 
 others . <end>   908.0745801498933
<start> <start> Gardiner was surprised and concerned ; but as they were now 
 approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to 
 the charm of recollection ; and she was too much engaged in pointing out 
 to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of 
 any thing else . <end>   423.6565901189561
<start> <start> Mr . Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight , but his 
 reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his 
 first introduction . <end>   325.46126401596223
<start> <start> Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her 
 in contempt for it . <end>   84.64707184501663
<start> <start> CHAPTER XIX . 
 
 
 Had Elizabeth 's opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could 
 not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic 
 comfort . <end>   369.3144458154115
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy had been at her 
 sister 's wedding . <end>   21.186436345020184
<start> <start> A carat character is used to denote superscription . <end>   2287.3731441219365
<start> <start> But pride - - where there is a real 
 superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation . " 
 
 Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile . <end>   581.97112023647
<start> <start> Mrs . <end>   3.8458585008904347
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained 
 wonder , and when at last Mr . Collins allowed him time to speak , replied 
 with an air of distant civility . <end>   201.12074832236905
<start> <start> He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . <end>   230.74443007595795
<start> <start> Thank Heaven ! <end>   552.5401991676875
<start> <start> what felicity ! <end>   2061.3711913986735
<start> <start> She followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down . <end>   396.818043693439
<start> <start> His brother - in - law , Mr . Hurst , merely 
 looked the gentleman ; but his friend Mr . Darcy soon drew the attention 
 of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien ; and 
 the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after 
 his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year . <end>   481.03859625207343
<start> <start> In short , 
 I will do my best . " 
 
 " Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very 
 often . <end>   294.9133107444112
<start> <start> Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing 
 her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with 
 composure . <end>   444.58178817470866
<start> <start> My object 
 has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due 
 consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my _manner_ 
 has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . " 
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER XXI . 
 
 
 The discussion of Mr . Collins 's offer was now nearly at an end , and 
 Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily 
 attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother . <end>   366.22725415388055
<start> <start> He addressed 
 himself directly to Miss Bennet , with a polite congratulation ; Mr . Hurst 
 also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad ; " but diffuseness 
 and warmth remained for Bingley 's salutation . <end>   564.2350580999753
<start> <start> You are safe from me . " 
 
 " There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular 
 evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . " 
 
 " And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body . " 
 
 " And yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand 
 them . " 
 
 " Do let us have a little music , " - - cried Miss Bingley , tired of a 
 conversation in which she had no share . - - " Louisa , you will not mind my 
 waking Mr . Hurst . " 
 
 Her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano - forte was 
 opened , and Darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for 
 it . <end>   183.68349513140228
<start> <start> This observation would not have prevented her 
 from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an 
 inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity 
 of saying much . <end>   691.6634996050509
<start> <start> I am quite well . <end>   16.363870338141737
<start> <start> Mr . Bingley was 
 unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be 
 civil also , and say what the occasion required . <end>   454.6653810927854
<start> <start> Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could 
 regard with any complacency . <end>   299.6542448812114
<start> <start> Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . <end>   687.511405038527
<start> <start> But I dare not 
 hope it . <end>   155.9130073766328
<start> <start> Kitty , run down and order the carriage . <end>   293.26095448217905
<start> <start> She became jealous of his esteem , when she could no 
 longer hope to be benefited by it . <end>   150.9517320380827
<start> <start> To Kitty , however , it does not 
 seem so wholly unexpected . <end>   138.1371632184916
<start> <start> If your abhorrence of 
 _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented 
 by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may 
 be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find 
 some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course 
 of the morning . <end>   683.2748210973036
<start> <start> She was even 
 sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how 
 steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and 
 confidence subsisted between Mr . Darcy and herself . <end>   524.3840988189382
<start> <start> or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? " 
 
 " You take an eager interest in that gentleman 's concerns , " said Darcy in 
 a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . <end>   505.36383924961416
<start> <start> In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to 
 Meryton and see how every body went on ; but Elizabeth steadily opposed 
 the scheme . <end>   467.20074834953044
<start> <start> Gardiner 's 
 long letter , but now , having _that_ to communicate which she knew would 
 be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt 
 had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as 
 follows : 
 
 " I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have 
 done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but 
 to say the truth , I was too cross to write . <end>   239.93408757719496
<start> <start> Elizabeth received 
 them with all the forbearance of civility ; and at the request of the 
 gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship 's carriage was 
 ready to take them all home . <end>   170.8329819226733
<start> <start> On Saturday he came again . <end>   651.6543477635037
<start> <start> " My dear Madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly 
 gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you 
 may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as 
 possible . " 
 
 They were all astonished ; and Mr . Bennet , who could by no means wish for 
 so speedy a return , immediately said , 
 
 " But is there not danger of Lady Catherine 's disapprobation here , my 
 good sir ? - - You had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of 
 offending your patroness . " 
 
 " My dear sir , " replied Mr . Collins , " I am particularly obliged to you 
 for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so 
 material a step without her ladyship 's concurrence . " 
 
 " You cannot be too much on your guard . <end>   155.995784568871
<start> <start> He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their 
 aunt 's , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was 
 well talked over . - - To Elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged 
 that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed . <end>   667.0218716814724
<start> <start> Are not you 
 curious to hear how it was managed ? " 
 
 " No really , " replied Elizabeth ; " I think there cannot be too little said 
 on the subject . " 
 
 " La ! <end>   85.77495930558253
<start> <start> And we all know that Wickham has every charm of 
 person and address that can captivate a woman . " 
 
 " But you see that Jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of 
 Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . " 
 
 " Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? <end>   227.85654967281027
<start> <start> And 
 when we _do_ return , it shall not be like other travellers , without 
 being able to give one accurate idea of any thing . <end>   377.9386130140519
<start> <start> By Elizabeth 's instructions she began to comprehend that a 
 woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not 
 always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . <end>   484.02786630240047
<start> <start> I wish you had been there . <end>   37.43550402516972
<start> <start> yes - - it would be much better to 
 wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter 
 would be at Meryton again . <end>   370.3925424166736
<start> <start> They both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three 
 continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown 
 open , and their visitor entered . <end>   802.0979547419553
<start> <start> It gives me pain 
 to speak ill of a Darcy . <end>   209.15034898630034
<start> <start> But my dear Lydia , I don 't 
 at all like your going such a way off . <end>   352.4631665483838
<start> <start> He still loves me , and we are 
 engaged . " 
 
 Jane looked at her doubtingly . <end>   277.60131606747973
<start> <start> CHAPTER XIV . 
 
 
 One morning , about a week after Bingley 's engagement with Jane had been 
 formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the 
 dining - room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the 
 sound of a carriage ; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the 
 lawn . <end>   225.79150919558882
<start> <start> It does not often happen 
 that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of 
 independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in 
 love with only a few days before . " 
 
 " But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed , so 
 doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea . <end>   383.46714230055625
<start> <start> She liked 
 him too little to care for his approbation . <end>   330.15565129688645
<start> <start> He was always to have gone on 
 Saturday , and to Saturday he still meant to stay . <end>   362.64170333608587
<start> <start> Redistribution is 
 subject to the trademark license , especially commercial 
 redistribution . <end>   3079.4875295167617
<start> <start> Your 
 portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the 
 effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . <end>   1506.5115542473552
<start> <start> He has also _brotherly_ pride , 
 which with _some_ brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful 
 guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the 
 most attentive and best of brothers . " 
 
 " What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? " 
 
 He shook his head . - - " I wish I could call her amiable . <end>   250.48426289645585
<start> <start> Every sentence of 
 kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane . <end>   1097.420762362617
<start> <start> CHAPTER XIV . 
 
 
 The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning ; and Mr . Collins having 
 been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was 
 able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very 
 good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the 
 melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings . <end>   458.32717347629847
<start> <start> Gardiner abused her stupidity . <end>   1694.8894734950104
<start> <start> It is on your account that he has been 
 so frequently invited this week . <end>   313.94935763361957
<start> <start> In that 
 county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three 
 weeks ; and to Mrs . <end>   273.84074282738266
<start> <start> Soon after 
 you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what 
 part of London they were . <end>   473.3727766120172
<start> <start> It must be an amusing study . " 
 
 " Yes ; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing . <end>   185.93059503515357
<start> <start> He spoke well , but there were feelings besides 
 those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the 
 subject of tenderness than of pride . <end>   470.031294414818
<start> <start> Mr . Darcy danced 
 only once with Mrs . <end>   60.2314309510537
<start> <start> Donations are accepted in a number of other 
 ways including checks , online payments and credit card donations . <end>   2100.6825523116704
<start> <start> Had Elizabeth been at leisure 
 to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was 
 impossible to one so wretched as herself ; but she had her share of 
 business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to 
 be written to all their friends in Lambton , with false excuses for their 
 sudden departure . <end>   759.0643830583659
<start> <start> and to see dear Wickham too ! <end>   947.8824717337911
<start> <start> But I must write no more . <end>   79.80516195551333
<start> <start> The loo table , however , did not appear . <end>   250.09807166764213
<start> <start> I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , 
 I assure you . <end>   412.34639729835607
<start> <start> Forgive 
 me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make _me_ your 
 confidante . " 
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER XIII . 
 
 
 A few days after this visit , Mr . Bingley called again , and alone . <end>   170.54813478722346
<start> <start> The horses 
 were post ; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who 
 preceded it , were familiar to them . <end>   835.2886919928189
<start> <start> The business was therefore soon settled . <end>   446.4464111764832
<start> <start> Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia 's
